          "While evidence can be a critical input for policymaking, our understanding of how it flows from research and expert communities to elite decision-makers remains remarkably limited. Studying these flows, and the relationships that underpin them, is inherently difficult. They are fragmented, politically mediated, and largely unobservable. This dissertation addresses these challenges by advancing a data-extensive computational social science approach, drawing on alternative (largely unstructured) data sources to systematically observe and characterize elite–evidence interactions. This project consists of four studies, involves the creation of new data infrastructures, and provides a foundation for future research and a proof of concept for investigating these dynamics. The first study analyzes behavioral data from nearly 3,700 legislators across 12 countries to examine how elected officials follow and interact with academic researchers on Twitter, revealing that engagement is rare and shaped by partisanship and educational background, though exogenous shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic can increase attention to medical expertise. The second study maps the evidence cited in 1.2 million policy documents across 185 countries, demonstrating the persistent dominance of research produced in the global North and highlighting systematic epistemic asymmetries in policy-relevant knowledge. The third study introduces the Bundestag Expert Witness Tracker (BEWIT), capturing all public expert hearings in the German Bundestag from 2009 to 2024, and shows how political gatekeeping and transparency reforms shape which experts inform legislative processes. The fourth study develops and validates the INSPIRE instrument, a psychometrically robust measure of scientific evidence consumption literacy for public policy contexts, providing a framework for assessing individuals’ capacity to engage with complex evidence. Together, these studies offer new perspectives on who gets seen and heard, what kinds of expertise gain traction, and how institutional and individual factors can shape evidence use in practice.",
          "Quantum computing introduces a revolutionary computational paradigm for social data analysis. Traditional social data processing methods face significant challenges in handling high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and dynamic datasets. Quantum computing, leveraging quantum superposition, entanglement, and parallel computation, provides efficient solutions for large-scale optimization, pattern recognition, and decision analysis. This paper systematically explores the applications of quantum computing in social sciences, covering theoretical foundations, methodological frameworks, experimental validations, and case studies to highlight the advantages of quantum algorithms in social network analysis, sentiment classification, and economic forecasting. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of quantum computing for social science research paradigms, ethical and governance concerns, and future development directions, emphasizing the integration of quantum computing with artificial intelligence. This paper aims to provide new insights into computational social science and advance the practical adoption of quantum computing in social data processing.",

          "This white paper introduces the Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE), a systems-engineering framework designed to simulate the evolution of complex civilizations. By treating narrative not as a scripted story, but as an emergent property of legal, economic, and ontological systems, the SOE framework transforms \"world-building\" into a rigorous discipline of Civilization Modeling. While the core architecture is genre-agnostic, this paper demonstrates its application through the lens of a new design-fiction school: Speculative Procedural Ontopunk (SPO). Reference ImplementationsThis framework is currently operational in two distinct genres: Sci-Fi (SPO): The Codex Totalis (The Caldwell Legacy) Fantasy (Magocracy): The Codex Octavis (The Octavian Archives) Review the SOE Framework in Notebook LM: [LINK] Abstract This paper introduces the Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE), a rigorous and extensible framework for civilization-modeling that treats narrative as an emergent, verifiable output of a complex system. We propose an alternative methodological framework for narrative construction, moving from traditional \"world-building\" to a disciplined form of civilization-modeling grounded in systems theory. While the reference implementation focuses on a school of design-fiction we term Speculative Procedural Ontopunk (SPO), the underlying architecture is genre-agnostic. The framework prioritizes the administrative, legal, and ontological protocols of a civilization as the primary drivers of conflict. The core of the SOE is a recursive causal algorithm, the Antivalent Cycle, which models historical progression as a series of codified systemic responses to emergent crises. This process is governed by the Antivalent Design Principle, grounded in theories of complex systems. We detail the MODEL Framework’s four-component architecture—the Kernel, the Variable, the Cycle, and the CORE—and utilize the THREAD Axioms to constrain the logic of the reference simulation. The result is a transparent, repeatable engine for architecting \"Societal Flight Simulators,\" reframing narrative creation as a disciplined form of speculative social modeling analogous to computational social science. The canonical instantiation of this framework is the Codex Totalis.

          "Computational communication research (CCR) has emerged as an early and active subfield within computational social science, offering novel methodological approaches to address classical and emerging questions in communication research. This paper reviews the evolution and methodological developments in CCR in both the international research community and Chinese mainland, emphasizing the role of computational methods such as user analytics, content mining, and computational experiments. We map the alignment between traditional quantitative methods and computational ones, demonstrating how CCR methods have complemented and enhanced existing research paradigms. Through empirical applications, we illustrate the utility of CCR in understanding user behavior, content dynamics, and communication effects. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of using computational methods in the Chinese context and the future directions for CCR.",
          "With the rise of Computational Social Science (CSS), researchers increasingly rely on big data and computational methods to analyze mediated environmental communication. This chapter summarizes characteristics, opportunities, and limitations of such methodological advances to analyze communication about the environment. It illustrates that access to big data is characterized by reliance on application programming interfaces, databases, crawling, and scraping, which often require programming skills. Researchers use automated content analysis or network analysis as examples of computational methods to measure a range of variables: the salience of communication, actors, communities, positioning, or framing. Opportunities related to the rise of CSS include access to more and different data, disaggregation of data, and analyses across time and space. However, important limitations concern inadequate measurements of complex constructs, for example, frames, and reliance on convenience samples, for instance via Twitter. The chapter closes with key recommendations, including the avoidance of \"black box\" commercial software tools, an increased need for validation, and a turn towards open science.",
          "The challenge of disentangling political communication processes and their effects has grown with the complexity of the new political information environment. But so have scientists' toolsets and capacities to better study and understand them. We map the challenges and opportunities of developing, synthesizing, and applying data collection and analysis techniques relying primarily on computational methods and tools to answer substantive theory-driven questions in the field of political communication. We foreground the theoretical, empirical, and institutional opportunities and challenges of Computational Communication Science (CCS) that are relevant to the political communication community. We also assess understandings of CCS and highlight challenges associated with data and resource requirements, as well as those connected with the theory and semantics of digital signals. With an eye to existing practices, we elaborate on the key role of infrastructures, academic institutions, ethics, and training in computational methods. Finally, we present the six full articles and two forum contributions of this special issue illustrating methodological innovation, as well as the theoretical, practical, and institutional relevance and challenges for realizing the potential of computational methods in political communication.",
          "Crowdfunding via the internet is a relatively new phenomenon in research and gaining momentum currently. While taking a data-driven approach into investigating the properties and dynamics of crowdfunding campaigns would allow the use of computational social science in investigations on crowdfunding, existing data-driven research on crowdfunding remains very limited. This is particularly true on the level of individual funder data. In this study, we contribute to the empirical body of knowledge on crowdfunding by introducing Indiegogo as a data source and, more specifically, the development and implementation of a crawler and scraper for accessing Indiegogo campaign data, and sharing this openly for other researchers. Due to the extremely dynamic and rapidly increasing amount of crowdfunding data in terms of the number of crowdfunding campaigns and the available investment and individual investor data, we believe our approach is useful for supporting public and open data-driven research, instead of providing merely a static data set.",
          "This tutorial aims at outlining fundamental methods for studying typical social science research questions with organic data (i.e., data that has not been designed for a specific research purpose but can be found on the Web). Further, social theories, statistical methods and models that help to understand the processes that generated the data will be discussed. Participants will learn (1) how to turn theoretical assumptions into models and test them, (2) how to validate measurements and (3) how to approximate causality when working with organic data.",
          "The hipster paradox in Electronic Dance Music is the phenomenon that commercial success is collectively considered illegitimate while serious and aspiring professional musicians strive for it. We study this behavioral dilemma using digital traces of performing live and releasing music as they are stored in the \\textit{Resident Advisor}, \\textit{Juno Download}, and \\textit{Discogs} databases from 2001-2018. We construct network snapshots following a formal sociological approach based on bipartite networks, and we use network positions to explain success in regression models of artistic careers. We find evidence for a structural trade-off among success and autonomy. Musicians in EDM embed into exclusive performance-based communities for autonomy but, in earlier career stages, seek the mainstream for commercial success. Our approach highlights how Computational Social Science can benefit from a close connection of data analysis and theory.",
          "One of the major public health findings in recent years has been the discovery of the strong impact of an individual's social network on the individual's health as well as habits. A number of studies have shown that physical health factors such as obesity, emotional health factors such as happiness, and habits such as smoking and exercise are significantly impacted by the individual's social network. Based on this, there has been increasing interest in the application of network theory and system dynamics to the study of public health.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nAmong a range of public health issues, adolescent health is particularly important for a number of reasons. First, given their developmental stage, adolescents are particularly sensitive to, and impacted by, their social networks. Second, many lifelong health habits or risk behaviors are established during adolescence (e.g. cigarette smoking, alcohol use). Third, adolescents represent the future workforce of the nation, thus their long-term health is critically important for the economy. This makes it especially important to study the impact of social networks on adolescent health.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nWhile the invention of the Internet, Web, mobile phones and personal digital assistants have revolutionized many walks of life, the most relevant to our present discussion is the creation of various online social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, MySpace, Twitter). These sites allow new forms of person-to-person interactions, with negligible cost, low latency, and high bandwidth; with the overall effect being one of dramatically increasing the intensity and continuity of communication between people. Many end up spending more attention on online social networks, often at the expense of face-to-face interaction. While this 'attention displacement' from the physical world to the online world potentially raises interesting socio-psychological questions on its own, the fact that the online world is having a significant impact on our lives is unquestioned. Given that usage of online social networking sites is growing at a very rapid rate among adolescents, essentially having become a de facto socialization mechanism in this age group, its impact on adolescent health is expected to be commensurately high, and thus a correspondingly important area of inquiry.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nWhile on the one hand the new information and communication technologies have created the tools for new means (and kinds) of socialization, as a complement, the tremendous data collection abilities of these very same technologies provide a perfect opportunity to study these socializations at a granularity which was previously unimaginable. Use of advanced computational methods to analyze detailed behavioral data is bringing about a revolution in the way social science questions can be studied, and has led to the rapid emergence of the discipline of computational social science.&#13;\\n...&lt;br /&gt;[NOTE - Abstract continues in actual report]",
          "Researchers often face the problem of needing to protect the privacy of subjects while also needing to integrate data that contains personal information from diverse data sources in order to conduct their research. The advent of computational social science and the enormous amount of data about people that is being collected makes protecting the privacy of research subjects evermore important. However, strict privacy procedures can make joining diverse sources of data that contain information about specific individual behaviors difficult. In this paper we present a procedure to keep information about specific individuals from being \"leaked\" or shared in either direction between two sources of data. To achieve this goal, we randomly assign individuals to anonymous groups before combining the anonymized information between the two sources of data. We refer to this method as the Yahtzee procedure, and show that it performs as expected theoretically when we apply it to data from Facebook and public voter records.",
          "This study conducts a systematic literature review to explore the mechanisms and research progress regarding the impact of Responsible Human Resource Management (RHRM) on Employee Well-Being (EWB). Following the SPAR-4-SLR structured protocol, articles published in Q1 and Q2 journals from the Scopus and Web of Science databases were rigorously screened. The Theory-Context-Characteristics-Methodology (TCCM) framework was applied to integrate multi-dimensional knowledge. The findings reveal that RHRM positively influences EWB through mediating mechanisms such as organizational pride, organizational identification, and job satisfaction, although theoretical inconsistencies remain regarding moderating variables. Additionally, notable research gaps exist in cross-cultural comparisons, dynamic mechanisms, and intervention pathways driven by digital technologies. This study recommends that future research leverage computational social science methods, including machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, strengthen causal inference. By promoting theoretical integration and paradigm innovation, this review offers methodological insights for constructing a knowledge graph of the RHRM-EWB field and provides practical implications for designing human-centered sustainable development strategies in organizations.",

Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length.FindingsChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations.Research limitations/implicationsAs an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings.Practical implicationsHigh warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design.Social implicationsDeployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling.Originality/valueThis paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",
          "&lt;p&gt; I examine how white nationalist organizations in the U.S. South distributed their attention across grievances and other organizations in their field between 1980 and 2008. I ask two main research questions. First, why do organizations focus their attention on one set of grievances at the expense of others? I refer to this as &lt;i&gt;grievance-based attention-focusing&lt;/i&gt;. Second, why are some organizations more likely to be taken as a point of reference by other organizations in their field? I refer to this as &lt;i&gt;peer attention-getting&lt;/i&gt;. I use a combination of archival data, natural language processing, network analysis, and statistical modeling to address these questions. In the case of grievance-based attention-focusing, I put forth a theory outlining the conditions under a white nationalist organization is more likely to shift attention to immigration-related issues. I find that these organizations were more likely to shift attention to immigration when there was a high number of domestic non-right-wing terror events relative to the size of the organization’s non-Hispanic/Latino community size, but only when the organization was disposed toward a cognitive style emphasizing the perception of threats and opportunities for action as proximate. In the case of peer attention-getting, I posit that any given organization has a higher capacity for garnering internal peer attention when they also have leaders that are high status enough to warrant external countermovement attention—but that the peer attention-getting capacity for these groups is positively moderated to the extent that the organization presents itself discursively with fearful language. I find support for this theory, and also find that attention-rich organizations are most inclined to divvy out attention to their peers that communicate with fearful language because of their own proclivity for using fear as an attention-getting mechanism. I conclude with implications for culture and cognition studies, computational social science, and broader discussions of organized racism in the contemporary United States.&lt;/p&gt;",
          "This project examines how social and traditional media can serve as alternative sources of information for understanding crime and violence, particularly in contexts where official crime statistics are incomplete, delayed, or unreliable. Bringing together perspectives from criminology, media studies, and computational social science, the project explores media-derived “signals” of crime and violence, including social media posts, news coverage, and other forms of user-generated or mediated reporting.",
          "In the literature, smart grids are modeled as cyber-physical power systems without considering the computational social aspects. However, end-users are playing a key role in their operation and response to disturbances via demand response and distributed energy resources. Therefore, due to the critical role of active and passive end-users and the intermittency of renewable energy, smart grids must be planned and operated by considering the computational social aspects in addition to the technical aspects. The level of cooperation, flexibility, and other social features of the various stakeholders, including consumers, prosumers, and microgrids, affect the system efficiency, reliability, and resilience. In this paper, we design an artificial society simulating the interaction between power systems and the social communities that they serve via agent-based modeling inspired by Barsade's theory on the emotional spread. The simulation results show a decline in the consumers' and prosumers' satisfaction levels induced by a shortage of electricity. It also shows the effects of social diffusion via the Internet and mass media on the satisfaction level. In view of the importance of computational social science for power system applications and the limited number of publications devoted to it, we provide a list of research topics that need to be achieved to enhance the reliability and resilience of power systems' operation and planning.",
          "Abstract As a design science, public administration is focused on addressing real‐world problems. However, within public administration argument and evidence on the relevance of academic research to practice agendas is equivocal. We investigate the “academic–practitioner divide” using computational social science techniques to identify the topics of “academic,” “academic–practitioner,” and practitioner corpora over a 25‐year period. Topic modeling results of the 50 topics identified in each of these corpora suggest that the topics of academics and practitioners have more differences than similarities: nearly seven‐tenths of the identified topics differ between the practice corpus and the academic and academic–practice corpora. Corpus linguistics analysis is applied to contrast the keyness of topics over time, and the results confirm the largely different agendas of the corpora albeit with some convergence on governance and outcomes. Corpora examined in this article is largely suggestive of a lack of relevance of academic research to practice agendas.",

          "A Dataset by the Social Media & Hate Research Lab, Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism (ISCA), Borns Jewish Studies Program. DATASET OVERVIEW This dataset contains 737 English-language tweets mentioning “Israel,” collected between November and December 2023. It includes topics related to Jews, Israel, and antisemitism, with dual annotations for both antisemitic content and tweets calling out antisemitism. DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY Data were collected from the Twitter/X Archive using the keyword “Israel” during November and December 2023. Due to API restrictions, we collected 100 posts three times per day. Technical issues with our data collection system resulted in occasional downtime; however, we maintained consistent data collection for the first three weeks of both months (November 1–21 and December 1–21). November 2023: 4,369 posts collected; 500 randomly sampled for analysis.December 2023: 4,792 posts collected; 500 randomly sampled for analysis. After excluding deleted tweets or unavailable accounts: November 2023 included 381 tweets, of which 115 were classified as antisemitic (30.18%).December 2023 included 356 tweets, of which 99 were classified as antisemitic (27.81%). In total, 737 tweets were annotated, and 214 (29.04%) were classified as antisemitic. Additionally, 20 tweets in November (5.25%) and 24 in December (6.74%) were annotated as calling out antisemitism. ANNOTATION PROCESS Annotation was conducted via the AnnotHate Portal (annotate.osome.iu.edu; see Jikeli, Soemer, & Karali, 2024), which allows annotators to review posts in full conversational and visual context, including images, threads, and quoted material. Each tweet was annotated by two independent annotators affiliated with the Social Media & Hate Research Lab at Indiana University. Annotators underwent extensive training in discourse analysis, antisemitism typology, and multimodal contextualization. A second annotation round was conducted to specifically identify tweets that call out or condemn antisemitism, aiming to reduce false positives in deep-learning and hate-speech detection models. FILE DESCRIPTION The dataset is provided in CSV format, where each row represents a single tweet. Columns include: id: Unique identifier for each tweet text: Full, unprocessed tweet text created_at: Timestamp of publication Antisemitism: Binary label indicating whether the tweet is antisemitic (1) or not (0) calling_out: Binary label indicating whether the tweet explicitly calls out or condemns antisemitism (1) or not (0) ACCESS TO FULL DATASET In accordance with Twitter/X data-sharing policies, the public release includes only tweet IDs and annotations. We are happy to provide the full dataset, including tweet text, upon request for non-commercial research purposes.For access inquiries, please contact us via mail.

          "This chapter provides an overview of computational communication science (CCS) as an emerging and exemplary subfield of computational social science. Based on lessons from working group sessions with 34 experts, we address recent challenges and desiderata of CCS research while reflecting upon its future development and expansion. Four major fields of action proved particularly relevant in these discussions: First, challenges related to a reflected but integrated CCS methodology; second, challenges related to a further elaboration on the theoretical perspectives on CCS; third, challenges related to the formation and further institutionalization of CCS as fundamental basis for further scientific exchange, progress and standardization; and fourth, implications for empirical communication research, particularly highlighting the relevance of wicked problems as research incubators driving further progress.",
          "&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Energy, demand response provides an opportunity for end-users to play a significant role in the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and sustainability of a power grid. This is made possible owing to the existence of storage devices and diversity of energy sources at the customer level and the advent of the Internet of Things. Social influences and psychological traits of consumers affect their behavior and decision-making. Consequently, there is a necessity to bring the influences of humans, organizations, and societies on the power system together through computational social science into a cyber-physical-social system. Hence, in this brief, we introduce our development of an artificial society of the social demand response of a power system, a well-known approach in computational sociology based on a bottom-up approach, starting from theory. We assume that consumers can engage in demand response to fulfill two aims: save their cost or enhance the sustainability of a power system. The literature concerning sustainability-based demand response is limited to only considering CO2, NOX, and SO2. In addition to NOX, and SO2, we examine the impact of power systems on water pollution, disability-adjusted loss of life year, and exergy in demand response, and provide an environomic-based social demand response. We show that when the level of satisfaction and cooperation of end-user is low, the marginal level of load shaving and improvement in sustainability cannot be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "The Multi-platform Aggregated Dataset of Online Communities (MADOC) is a comprehensive dataset that facilitates computational social science research by providing a unified, standardized dataset for cross-platform analysis of online social dynamics. MADOC aggregates and standardizes data from four distinct platforms: Bluesky, Koo, Reddit, and Voat, spanning from 2012 to 2024. The dataset includes 18.9 million posts, 236 million comments, and data from 23.1 million unique users across all platforms, with a particular focus on understanding community dynamics, user migration patterns, and the evolution of toxic behavior across platforms. By providing standardized data structures and FAIR-compliant access through Zenodo and corresponding Python and R packages, MADOC enables researchers to conduct comparative analyses of user behavior, interaction networks, and content sentiment across diverse social media environments. The unique value of the dataset lies in its cross-platform scope, standardized structure, and rich metadata, making it particularly suitable for studying societal phenomena such as community formation, toxic behavior propagation, and user migration patterns in response to platform moderation policies.",
          "Existing work on the alignment problem has focused mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a monolith. Recent sociotechnical approaches highlight the need to understand complex misalignment among multiple human and AI agents. We address this gap by adapting a computational social science model of human contention to the alignment problem. Our model quantifies misalignment in large, diverse agent groups with potentially conflicting goals across various problem areas. Misalignment scores in our framework depend on the observed agent population, the domain in question, and conflict between agents' weighted preferences. Through simulations, we demonstrate how our model captures intuitive aspects of misalignment across different scenarios. We then apply our model to two case studies, including an autonomous vehicle setting, showcasing its practical utility. Our approach offers enhanced explanatory power for complex sociotechnical environments and could inform the design of more aligned AI systems in real-world applications.",
          "Many outcomes of interest in the social and health sciences, as well as in modern applications in computational social science and experimentation on social media platforms, are ordinal and do not have a meaningful scale. Causal analyses that leverage this type of data, termed ordinal non-numeric, require careful treatment, as much of the classical potential outcomes literature is concerned with estimation and hypothesis testing for outcomes whose relative magnitudes are well defined. Here, we propose a class of finite population causal estimands that depend on conditional distributions of the potential outcomes, and provide an interpretable summary of causal effects when no scale is available. We formulate a relaxation of the Fisherian sharp null hypothesis of constant effect that accommodates the scale-free nature of ordinal non-numeric data. We develop a Bayesian procedure to estimate the proposed causal estimands that leverages the rank likelihood. We illustrate these methods with an application to educational outcomes in the General Social Survey.",
          "In modeling social interaction online, it is important to understand when\\npeople are reacting to each other. Many systems have explicit indicators of\\nreplies, such as threading in discussion forums or replies and retweets in\\nTwitter. However, it is likely these explicit indicators capture only part of\\npeople's reactions to each other, thus, computational social science approaches\\nthat use them to infer relationships or influence are likely to miss the mark.\\nThis paper explores the problem of detecting non-explicit responses, presenting\\na new approach that uses tf-idf similarity between a user's own tweets and\\nrecent tweets by people they follow. Based on a month's worth of posting data\\nfrom 449 ego networks in Twitter, this method demonstrates that it is likely\\nthat at least 11% of reactions are not captured by the explicit reply and\\nretweet mechanisms. Further, these uncaptured reactions are not evenly\\ndistributed between users: some users, who create replies and retweets without\\nusing the official interface mechanisms, are much more responsive to followees\\nthan they appear. This suggests that detecting non-explicit responses is an\\nimportant consideration in mitigating biases and building more accurate models\\nwhen using these markers to study social interaction and information diffusion.\\n",
          "In recent years, a major growth area in applied natural language processing has been the application of automated techniques to massive datasets in order to answer questions about society, and by extension people.Sociolinguistics, which combines anthropology, statistics and linguistics (e.g.Labov 1994Labov , 2001)), studies linguistic data in order to answer key questions about the relationship of language and society.Sociolinguists focus on frequency and patterns in linguistic usage, correlations, strength of factors and significance, which together reveal information about the sex, age, education and occupation of speakers/writers but also their history, culture, place of residence, social relationships and affiliations.The findings arising from this type research offer important insights into the nature of human organizations at the global, national or community level.They also reveal connections and interactions, the convergence and divergence of groups, historical associations and developing trends.",
          "This paper examines a novel proxy for political polarization, initially proposed by Caliskan et al., which estimates intergroup distances using computer vision. Analyzing 1,400+ YouTube videos with advanced object detection, their study quantifies demographic and religious divides in Turkiye, a deeply polarized nation. Our findings reveal strong correlations between intergroup distances and electoral polarization, measured via entropy-based voting metrics weighted by religiosity and political inclination. Two key insights emerge: (1) Greater distances between religious and nonreligious individuals (NRP vs RP) heighten electoral entropy, underscoring sociocultural fragmentation. (2) Intragroup diversity among nonreligious individuals (NRP vs NRP) stabilizes polarization, aligning with Axelrod's cultural dissemination model. This research advances computational social science and economics by showing that physical distancing serves as a scalable proxy for polarization, complementing traditional economic indicators.",
          "Who writes the news in the Chilean press according to gender? Who are the sources, male or female, in the Chilean press? Is there a relationship between the gender of journalists and the gender of the sources in the Chilean press? This article studies the gender of the Chilean newsroom and their sources in 12,113 news through a quantitative method with a computational social science approach. This method combines web scraping and natural language processing techniques to gather and preprocess data, facilitating the exploration of complex social phenomena. Results show important biases in journalists and source gender. From a sample of 158 journalists, 99 were men (63%) and 59 women (37%). Also, from 12,113 news, 7,565 (62%) were written by male and 4,548 (38%) by female journalists. Of the 12,334 sources mentioned in the news, 9,771 were men (79%) and 2,563 were women (21%). A significant finding is that equality in the newsroom is related to how female and male journalists choose their sources. In other words, when a media has a newsroom with gender equality, the sources of the journalists are more equitable too. These results have important insights to discuss within the journalism schools, to make students aware of the gender bias in the profession. Furthermore, if the presence of female – journalists or sources- increased in the media, it would allow them to grow their media power and status.",
          "In many fields today, such as neuroscience, remote sensing, computational social science, and physical sciences, multiple sets of data are readily available. Matrix and tensor factorizations enable joint analysis, i.e., fusion, of these multiple datasets such that they can fully interact and inform each other while also minimizing the assumptions placed on their inherent relationships. A key advantage of these methods is the direct interpretability of their results. This talk presents an overview of models based on independent component analysis (ICA), and its generalization to multiple datasets, independent vector analysis (IVA) with examples using neuroimaging data. A number of important challenges and future directions of research are addressed for solutions using not only ICA and IVA but also tensors and other matrix factorizations.",
          "Computational social science (CSS) is a field that integrates the study of humans and groups at all scales through the formal methodology of computational and mathematical models. Its purpose is to advance scientific understanding of social phenomena using computation both as a conceptual and theoretical paradigm, based on information processing, and as a methodological tool. Recently, a restrictive version of CSS has been proposed, driven by \"big data\" from social media and progress in algorithms from computer science, eschewing theory, mathematical models, and computational simulations – which are other core areas of CSS. This chapter presents a comprehensive and balanced scope of CSS that is theoretically and methodologically guided by theory, enriched by analytical models, and enabled by computer simulations, all three drawing on empirical data, be it big or small. After comparing the restrictive approach to CSS to two insightful metaphors, this chapter presents CSS as (a) an empirical science seeking deep and testable knowledge, (b) an integrative social science of humans and groups, and (c) a computational science that uses computer and mathematical models to advance our understanding of human and social dynamics. The scope of CSS is defined by five areas that constitute its core and borderlands that straddle the boundaries of CSS and other fields, as illustrated by contemporary theory and research on complex crises.",
          "Abstract The information systems literature has studied digital innovation extensively and focused primarily on its commercial related objectives. Yet, digital social innovations (DSIs) seek to solve social problems, while implementing commercially viable approaches. Drawing from the social entrepreneurship literature and using computational social science methods, we identify the peculiar utilitarian (commercial) and collectivistic (social) identity orientations that shape DSI. We use a sample of 292 DSI initiatives from Latin America and find that DSIs present both utilitarian and collectivist identity orientation. We also find that the collectivistic identity orientation tends to be more salient in less developed contexts. This allows us to discuss implications for the research on DSI and to open up a discussion on the role of context and possible tensions that may emerge in combining both identity orientations.",
          "Food waste as a complex social system: How computational social science can help Researchers in Norway use computer modeling to understand the social complexities of food waste and to test potential interventions that could be part of the solution. How can computational social science contribute to this understanding? Addressing complex social issues like food waste are not just about individual decisions or technical inefficiencies. They are entangled within social norms, human motivations, and situational constraints that interact in unpredictable ways. Traditional research methods can measure correlations or test limited interventions, but they struggle to capture the richness of these dynamic social systems.",
          "To what extent can data science methods â€“ such as machine learning, text analysis, or sentiment analysis â€“ push the research frontier in the social sciences? This chapter briefly describes the most prominent data science techniques that lend themselves to analyses of institutional and organizational governance structures. The authors elaborate on several examples applying data science to analyze legal, political, and social institutions and sketch how specific data science techniques can be used to study important research questions that could not (to the same extent) be studied without these techniques. They conclude by comparing the main strengths and limitations of computational social science with traditional empirical research methods and its relation to theory.",
          "Integrating massive social data with traditional social sciences, the computational social science (CSS) is crucial for understanding the Internet of Things (IoT)-based nondeterministic social systems. Event predictability is the fundamental premise of widespread societal event predictions with CSS. Due to data quality, model suitability, and the nondeterministic nature of IoT-based social systems, the event predictability is difficult to be characterized. Based on Turing computability and prediction error tolerability, this article posits a uniform event predictability theory. With discrepancy and Rademacher complexity, the generalization error bound is utilized to represent data quality and model suitability. Together with thresholds for the generalization error bound and confidence, the event predictability is modeled in a probabilistic manner to capture the nondeterminism within IoT-based social systems. The event predictability theory is theoretically proved and validated, and utilizing the proposed approximation algorithm for discriminating event predictability (AADEP), its applicability is further verified by experiments on a real-world data set for IoT-based nondeterministic social systems.",
          "Actions to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis are urgently needed but face societal inertia due to decades of climate disinformation and discourses of policy delay. Behavioral science research has the potential to develop evidence-based strategies to fight disinformation; however, this research has not been conducted systematically nor with validated sets of climate disinformation stimuli that would enable researchers and practitioners to reliably evaluate and compare the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. Using computational social science techniques, we gathered n = 20’000 climate disinformation stimuli from the social media platform Twitter and conducted a validation study involving a representative sample of N = 503 British participants. We present the Climate Disinformation Corpus, a collection of climate disinformation statements designed to systematize experimental research on future disinformation interventions. We identified seventy-eight statements containing disinformation about the existence, the causes, the consequences of climate change, the reliability and objectivity of climate scientists, and arguing for the delay of climate policies by redirecting and minimizing responsibility, pushing non-transformative solutions, emphasizing the downsides of climate actions, or surrendering to climate change consequences. The Climate Disinformation Corpus showed good heterogeneity across fifteen validation measures (e.g., perceived persuasiveness, perceived trustworthiness, and sharing intentions) taken from established disinformation research guidelines. Furthermore, the climate disinformation statements were correlated with four individual differences measures related to belief in climate science and support for climate actions, congruently with theoretical expectations. We conclude with practical suggestions on implementing the Climate Disinformation Corpus in disinformation research according to different research questions.",
          "Finance has increasingly been positioned as a solution to the looming threat of the climate crisis.In recent decades, green finance has evolved from niches of socially responsible investments tocenter stage of financial and climate governance. At the same time, green finance has expandedinto a trillion-dollar industry. Yet, while both experts and organizations have exhibited increasedrecognition of climate change as a financial risk, we are still grappling with the failure of climatechange mitigation. This dissertation takes its point of departure in this puzzling tension and asksthe following question: How do experts and organizations enable or constrain green finance?Contributing to the interdisciplinary scholarship on green finance, this dissertation foregroundshow actors and objects interact and what the distributional consequences are in the creation,maintenance, and contestation of green finance. Speaking to the interdisciplinary literature ongreen finance governance, I draw on International Political Economy and Science and TechnologyStudies to approach green finance as an evolving financial infrastructure where actors competefor authority over what counts as green. This is theorized and investigated empirically across fourresearch papers, drawing on cases ranging from EU sustainable finance to accounting standards,the classification of stranded assets, and contestations around ESG. Taken together, the empiricalcases illustrate how experts and organizations cooperate and contend, either to obstruct or supportgreen finance.As such, this dissertation makes three main contributions to the field of green finance andinternational political economy. First, I develop an interdisciplinary theoretical approach linkingactors to objects and infrastructural power. Second, I offer novel empirical insights that advanceknowledge about the evolving nature of green finance. Third, this dissertation contributes toadvancing a mixed-methods approach, which integrates computational social science methodswith qualitative analysis to trace interactions – contestation and cooperation – across actors andobjects. Taken together, these contributions help illustrate how experts and organizations enableor hinder green finance by battling it out over the objects and definitions that contribute to themaintenance, creation, or contestation of green financial infrastructure.",
          "We are at an exciting moment, when every field has taken a computational turn. We now have computational social science, computational biology, computational chemistry, or digital humanities; visual artists use languages like Processing to create multimedia art; 3-D printing allows sculptors to push further into physical possibilities with art. It's thrilling to consider the progress that has been made. However, as life has become more computational, people haven't changed. Just because we have open government data doesn't mean we don't have corruption. The tech-facilitated gig economy has exactly the same problems as labor markets have had since the beginning of the industrial age. Traditionally, journalists have investigated these types of social problems to create positive social change. In the computational world, the practice of investigative journalism has had to go high tech.",

          "In this project, we semantically enriched and enhanced the metadata of long text documents, theses and dissertations, retrieved from the HathiTrust Digital Library in English published from 1920 to 2020 through a combination of manual efforts and large language models. This dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing research in areas such as computational social science, digital humanities, and information science. Our paper shows that enriching metadata using LLMs is particularly beneficial for digital repositories by introducing additional metadata access points that may not have originally been foreseen to accommodate various content types. This approach is particularly effective for repositories that have significant missing data in their existing metadata fields, enhancing search results and improving the accessibility of the digital repository.",
          "The dawning of the digital research age – computational science, computational social science, and the digital humanities – brings with it both enormous potential and challenges. Visions of interactive publication, open data, reproducible results, and massive digital collections are exciting, opening up new research frontiers and the promise of more rapid dissemination of and building upon research ouput. However, to date, little of this vision has been realized. It remains challenging to reuse digital artifacts, precisely identify data used in a publication, and reproduce the results of published work. We leverage research in data citation and provenance collection and maintenance to prototype and evaluate a provenanceenabled citation service to facilitate better access to data sets and reproducibility of research results.",
          "This paper provides a comprehensive formal dynamical-systems account of romantic dissolution in long-term partnerships. Marriage is modelled as a two-agent cooperative system whose persistence depends on the non-empty and dynamically invariant intersection of the partners' individual viability sets. Drawing on the Unified Structural Theory of Complex Systems, the framework formalises ten mechanisms of interest attrition and shows that each can be represented as a special case of a general structural law. The ten core mechanisms analysed are: (1) viability mismatch, (2) reward-signal adaptation (biochemical habituation), (3) Quasi-Westermarck familiarity-induced suppression, (4) constraint–autonomy imbalance, (5) social contagion of dissolution norms, (6) economic cost–benefit asymmetries, (7) children as viability-set anchors, (8) media and social media norm distortion, (9) perceptual valence switching, and (10) serial monogamy as parameter renewal. Beyond these core mechanisms, the paper develops several extended analyses that situate romantic dissolution within broader biological, cultural, technological, legal, institutional, and normative contexts: Evolutionary context: Comparative primate mating systems, the phylogenetic origins of social monogamy, Fisher's \"four-year itch\" hypothesis, and the adaptive logic of serial monogamy across 58 societies. Children: trauma, intergenerational transmission, and instrumentalisation. An expanded treatment of children as the most consequential stakeholders in the dissolution process. Parental divorce is situated within the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) framework (Felitti et al., 1998; Merrick et al., 2018), with Amato's meta-analytic evidence on child outcome deficits across academic, psychological, and social domains. The intergenerational transmission of divorce (\"the divorce cycle\") is formalised through three channels: interpersonal behaviour deficits (the largest mediator), insecure attachment working models, and attitudinal normalisation of dissolution. Developmental pathways from childhood adversity to adult personality pathology are classified by their effects on the agent's parameter vector: anxious attachment (hypervigilance and autonomy contraction), avoidant attachment (emotional withdrawal and underinvestment), disorganised attachment (high-amplitude extractive oscillation), and externalising pathology (substance abuse, conduct disorder). A final subsection analyses the strategic instrumentalisation of children — parental alienation as epistemic attack, deployment of children as informants, and emotional extortion through custody leverage. Digital disruption: High-fidelity pornography and reward-threshold inflation, AI companion chatbots as synthetic alternative attractors, dating applications and the paradox of infinite perceived alternatives, consensual non-monogamy as system dimensionality expansion, and companion animals as partial attachment substitutes. Extractive oscillator dynamics as a continuum: Drawing on the formal extractive oscillator framework (Kriger, 2026), the paper argues that quasi-narcissistic dynamics are not a categorical pathology but a universal feature of intimate dyads, varying across couples only in degree, amplitude, and asymmetry. An asymmetry index is introduced and three structural regimes are characterised. Religion and secularisation: A cross-religious analysis (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism) of marriage as sacred institution, formalising the \"sacred exit barrier\" as a transcendent cost component. The progressive removal of this barrier through secularisation is modelled as the elimination of the historically dominant stabilisation mechanism. The legal system as structural force: A game-theoretic analysis of adversarial family law as a prisoner's dilemma that selects for mutual aggression over cooperative settlement. The section formalises temporal distortion (forced residence in non-viable state space during prolonged proceedings), financial extraction as secondary dissolution, custody weaponisation, jurisdictional arbitrariness as exogenous stochastic perturbation, the no-fault revolution as the legal analogue of secularisation, and mediation/collaborative divorce as mechanism-design interventions. The Nash bargaining solution for cooperative dissolution is derived. Same-sex dyads: A demonstration that the viability framework requires no structural modification for same-sex couples — the mechanisms are identical, only the empirical parameter values differ. Dissolution-rate asymmetries between female–female, male–male, and different-sex couples are interpreted through exit-barrier levels, constraint–autonomy dynamics, threshold asymmetries, and minority stress as exogenous viability-set contraction. Drawing on Kurdek's longitudinal programme and Scandinavian registry data. Domestic violence, institutional response, and strategic weaponisation. Genuine intimate partner violence formalised as high-amplitude extractive oscillation with three artificial exit-barrier mechanisms (terror, epistemic degradation, resource control). Comparative institutional analysis: Russia's 2017 decriminalisation as protective-barrier removal (with HRW, Wilson Center, and CEPA documentation); the United States' mandatory arrest paradoxes (Sherman's Milwaukee experiment showing 64% increased victim mortality after arrest; Campbell's femicide risk factors); Canada's mandatory charging and unintended victim criminalisation. Strategic weaponisation of allegations formalised as first-mover advantage in a game-theoretic framework, with empirical evidence from Bala et al. (2007) and Meier (2019). The dual crisis of under-protection and over-intervention identified as a common structural failure: one-dimensional binary classification where multi-dimensional assessment is required. Precursors of dissolution: Integration of Gottman's 40-year empirical programme (the Four Horsemen, cascade model, two-factor dissolution timing) with the viability framework, yielding a seven-step structured diagnostic hierarchy. The normative question: A balanced treatment of whether marriages should be \"saved\" or dissolution accepted as the evolutionary norm, with five structural projections for the future of intimate partnership over the next two to five decades. The mathematical framework employs viability theory, coupled differential equations, phase-transition models, game theory (prisoner's dilemma, Nash bargaining), attachment theory formalisation, and sigmoid threshold dynamics. Seven black-and-white TikZ figures illustrate viability-set geometry, reward decay, the Quasi-Westermarck curve, exit-barrier collapse, the mechanism-to-control-variable wheel, and parameter sweep sensitivity analyses. Five tables summarise control variables, testable predictions, model comparisons, cross-domain correspondences, and case vignettes. The resulting framework reinterprets \"loss of love\" not as an emotional or moral failure but as a structurally constrained trajectory in the parameter space of a dyadic persistence system — one shaped by deterministic tendencies but subject to irreducible stochastic and agentive variability.

          "We discuss two computational approaches of particular significance for rigorous sociology, Agent-Based Computational Modeling (ABCM) and Computational Social Science (CSS). CSS exploits novel sources of large-scale data from, for example, the Internet, telephone-communication records, or population register data, studying digital traces of social interaction with great precision. ABCM uses computer simulation to study how social regularities can arise from complex interactions among interdependent individuals. CSS and ABCM share a strong focus on computational methods, but only a few contributions combine them. We briefly introduce both approaches and argue that they can strongly benefit from more interaction and integration. ABCM can address the generalizability and theoretical explanation of empirical patterns identified in CSS, whilst empirical CSS can help validate and calibrate otherwise abstract models from ABCM. We discuss examples of a successful combination of both approaches and address directions for more theoretical and methodological integration in the future.",
          "Research in the digital humanities and computational social sciences requires overcoming complexity in research data, methodology, and research questions. In this article, we show through case studies of three different digital humanities and computational social science projects, that these problems are prevalent, multiform, as well as laborious to counter. Yet, without facilities for acknowledging, detecting, handling and correcting for such bias, any results based on the material will be faulty. Therefore, we argue for the need for a wider recognition and acknowledgement of the problematic nature of many DH/CSS datasets, and correspondingly of the amount of work required to render such data usable for research. These arguments have implications both for evaluating feasibility and allocation of funding with respect to project proposals, but also in assigning academic value and credit to the labour of cleaning up and documenting datasets of interest.",
          "The goal of the current study was to provide information on the potential of neuroscience mining (NSM) for comprehending NeuroIS paradigms. NSM is an interdisciplinary field that combines neuroscience and business mining, which is the application of big data analytics, computational social science, and other fields to business problems. Therefore, NSM makes it possible to apply predictive models to NeuroIS datasets, such as machine learning and deep learning, to find intricate patterns that are hidden by conventional regression-based analysis. We predicted 28 individual EEG power spectra separated brainwave data using a Random Forest (RF) model. Next, we used NSM to precisely predict how consumers would perceive a product online, depending on whether a light or dark user interface (UI) mode was being used. The model was then used to extract more precise results that could not be obtained using more conventional linear-based analytical models using sensitivity analysis. The benefits of using NSM in NeuroIS research are as follows: (1) it can relieve the burden of the three-horned dilemma described by Runkel and McGrath; (2) it can enable more temporal data to be directly analyzed on the target variables; and (3) sensitivity analysis can be performed on a condition/individual basis, strengthening the rigor of findings by reducing sample bias that can be lost in grand averaging of data when analyzed with methods like GLM.",

The quick-moving COVID-19 pandemic severely wounded economies and social institutions. In the United States, workplace shutdowns disrupted earnings for many workers as unemployment quadrupled over 2 months, with the official unemployment rate rising from 3.5% in February 2020 to 14.7% in April 2020 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). At the same time, police killings of Black Americans brought public outrage and widespread awareness of America's enduring racism. This second catastrophe—hundreds of years in the making—has held back our collective well-being, with harms falling most heavily on Black and Indigenous communities (McGhee, 2019).In this commentary, we draw on social welfare scholarship to offer thoughts on the current moment, focusing on the economic recession that began in February 2020. How vulnerable were Americans to the pandemic's economic effects? What policy steps improved, failed to improve, or worsened the situation? And—most crucially—how should we move forward?In the U.S. context, questions about the economy are often questions about the intersections of race and class. The most striking effects of the pandemic lie at the same intersection. Many of the institutions shaping the response to COVID-19 also shape—and are shaped by—the American social policies critiqued by critical race theorists and the Black Lives Matter movement as upholding white supremacy (Kolivoski et al., 2014; McCoy, 2020).Despite its limitations, social welfare policy scholarship provides insight into how we could address the current moment and build a more equitable future. Social welfare scholarship is principally concerned with naming the systemic chasms in our society and investigating inclusive ways to fill them. For example, the Grand Challenges for Social Work have attempted to provide a frame with which to understand the most pressing social issues while arguing for social policy as a key mechanism for change (Padilla & Fong, 2016). Our field emphasizes organized communal strategies, typically in the form of government programs and actions, in contrast with individualist solutions that rely on markets to allocate resources via interactions between buyers and sellers. Indeed, the social work profession originated in direct response to the market failures of the industrial revolution, with foundational work of the time documenting the disparate conditions of that era's essential workers. For example, the papers and maps of the residents of Hull House (1895) chronicled the living and working conditions among laborers on Chicago's near west side, including crowded tenements, sweatshops without fire escapes, and workers deformed from long hours of hunched labor. These findings served as the basis for some social policy reforms we still enjoy today, including child labor laws and public sanitation regulations.The insights of early social work leaders were not without key omissions, as contributions of Black social workers and other marginalized voices were ignored or suppressed (Carlton-LaNey, 1999; Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2009). The dominant views of social work's founders and subsequent generations have consistently reflected able-bodied, cisgender, white, heterosexual, patriarchal values regarding who is allowed to navigate systems, on what terms, and ultimately who deserves the full slate of rights in the United States. This has been seen at many points in our history, including in the early rhetoric conflating racialized immigrants' living conditions with moral failings (Park & Kemp, 2006), the exclusion of Black and other workers of color from the Social Security Act (Rodems & Schaefer, 2016; Stoetz, 2016), the forced removal of children from Native families (Evans-Campbell & Campbell, 2011), and the policing of women's sexuality as a condition of cash assistance (Gordon, 1994; Kunzel, 1993). The challenges of the current moment demand that we do better by recentering populations who are most marginalized in our conversations and investigations (Herrenkohl et al., 2020).Prepandemic Systemic VulnerabilitiesAlthough the mass unemployment and economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic were perhaps unforeseen, their effects are exacerbated by longstanding and racialized disparities in economic and policy structures (described in Henly et al., 2018). Inequalities in worker pay, health-related benefits, and workplace power hastened the spread of the virus as low-paid workers and those without health insurance or paid time off had to work despite risks to themselves and others. Pandemic-related shutdowns exposed society's reliance on historically disparaged or underrecognized forms of labor. For example, workers were quickly sorted into \"essential\" or nonessential categories, the latter working safely from their homes while the former ensured that food was available and stores remained stocked, that hospitals were cleaned, and that the workers doing these tasks could take transit to work. Importantly, Black workers disproportionately hold front-line jobs that expose them to greater health risks. Although just under 12% of all workers are Black, Black workers constitute 26% of public transit workers and 17.5% of health care workers (Gould & Wilson, 2020). Workers along every step of the food supply chain—also predominantly workers of color, including Latinx immigrants—took on new importance without gaining adequate protections at work (Farmworker Justice, 2020). These workers include agricultural laborers, slaughterhouse and meat plant workers, truckers, warehouse workers, and grocery store employees. The pandemic heightened the dangers of these roles and also exposed the conditions of the settings in which this work is carried out.Extreme racialized wealth inequality also hindered capacity to withstand economic disruption. Prepandemic, over a third of U.S. households could not cover an unexpected $400 expense (Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 2019). When the pandemic interrupted jobs, it caused immediate hardship for families without savings to buffer the lost income. Further, which Americans do—or do not—have savings reflects racialized policies. Wealth inequality is baked into the history of the United States—a country built on Native land with the forced labor of enslaved Africans (Darity & Mullen, 2020; Walters, 2019). Over the past several decades, America's wealth—cash savings, property, and business ownership—has become increasingly concentrated. Half of Americans collectively own less than 2% of all wealth in the United States, and in the past 30 years, the share of wealth held by the least wealthy half of Americans has decreased from 3.6% in 1990 to 1.8% in 2020 (Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 2020). Yet, American political forces align against redistributive measures, often because such measures are seen as disproportionately benefiting people of color (Quadagno, 1994).These historic forces manifested immediate hardships when the pandemic hit. For instance, food insecurity rose sharply during the pandemic's early months, with an estimated one in three families with children at risk of not having enough to eat (Schanzenbach & Tomeh, 2020). Spending dropped most dramatically in Black households (Ganong et al., 2020) as inequities in housing markets and policies further destabilized foundations. The longstanding home mortgage interest deduction has made homeownership the greatest vehicle of wealth creation in the country, with real estate comprising a household's most valuable asset (McCabe, 2016). The 2008 foreclosure crisis served as a hard-learned lesson on the economic impact of homeownership. The foreclosure crisis disproportionately impacted communities of color (Aalbers, 2009; Brueckner et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2015), and policy interventions failed to prevent the racially/ethnically biased predatory lending practices that precipitated it (Collins et al., 2013; Rodriguez, 2020). Approximately 19.4% of Latinx and 12.7% of Black homeowners nationally experienced foreclosure between 2007 and 2015 (Mikhitarian, 2019), a devastating share considering that 73.1% and 61.8% of Latinx and Black household wealth, respectively, was tied to real estate.Meanwhile, renters were faced with dramatic increases in market-rate prices when production of affordable units decreased and housing prices increased. As a result, renters were at high risk of homelessness when faced with a life or income shock (Curtis et al., 2013). Although the pandemic has lessened demand for rentals, the cost of rent has dropped only about $5 per month nationally between March and June 2020 (Zillow Research, 2020). People of color comprise a disproportionate share of renters, who are more likely than homeowners to face increasing housing costs and less likely to have wealth to weather any income shock. As a result, Black and Latinx households are more likely to double-up and live with two or more families in the same housing unit (Pilkauskas et al., 2014). These housing market inequities have poignant pandemic-era implications, as was seen for instance in COVID-19 spread due to overcrowded housing conditions (Jones & Grigsby-Toussaint, 2020; Neal & McCargo, 2020).Immediate ResponsesThe early federal pandemic response—the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and the Economic Security (CARES) Act (2020) and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA, 2020)—contained several major expansions of inclusions and rights, including some efforts long supported by economic justice advocates. First, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance extended unemployment protection to some groups of workers previously excluded from the Unemployment Insurance system. Newly eligible groups included part-time and gig workers, such as rideshare and delivery drivers who work on major app platforms. Overall, an estimated 11 million workers received benefits only due to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance expansions (Stone, 2020). Recipients of Unemployment Insurance benefits—long seen as inadequate, particularly in southern states (Chang, 2020)—received a temporary $600 per week increase through a related measure, although Congress allowed this benefit to expire after the initial 4 months. Importantly, these benefits were not extended to undocumented workers, though they comprise large portions of the workforce in the agricultural, food, and service sectors. For instance, close to half of hired crop farmworkers in the U.S. lack legal authorization (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020).Second, the FFCRA included the United States' first federal paid family leave and sick leave provisions. Workers who got sick or were required or advised to quarantine qualified for 2 weeks of paid medical leave. Parents or other caregivers could also qualify for up to 12 weeks of expanded leave to care for children whose school or childcare was unavailable for pandemic-related reasons. Unfortunately, these acts excluded some small employers as well as employers with more than 500 employees, a compromise influenced by concerns over cost as well as lobbying by major employer groups. Nevertheless, paid leave is important for preventing material hardship (Ybarra et al., 2019), and even temporary paid leave represents a major step forward for a country that heretofore largely relied on employers voluntarily granting workers leave. Permitting employers to decide which employees receive leave favors higher-status workers and disproportionately leaves workers of color—who can least afford to not work—without paid time off for illness or caregiving (Gould & Wilson, 2020).Third, the CARES Act also added protections to stabilize housing, albeit temporarily and without reducing debt. As of late November 2020, about 1 in 5 households paying rent and one in 10 homeowners paying mortgages were behind in payments (author calculations based on U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). For homeowners, the CARES Act temporarily banned foreclosure proceedings. However, homeowners must pay back the sum total of missed payments at some point during the life of the loan—with interest. For renters, the CARES Act placed a moratorium on evictions in federally subsidized rental housing, and various states and localities levied their own moratoriums beyond these, but rent is still due. Further, although federal housing tenants may be eligible for rent reductions, market-rate renters have no such programs available. As a whole, eviction moratoriums and mortgage forbearances reflect a policy consensus that market rules have to be changed in order to preserve people's rights to remain in housing. These policy measures temporarily bolster the power of renters and borrowers relative to more powerful landlords and lenders. However, if policymakers allow these measures to expire, renters and homeowners will need to pay rent and mortgage arrears or face eventual eviction/foreclosure.This Era Can Yield Big ReformsCan we sustain and further expand these emergency efforts? Progressive Era labor standards and the Social Security Act of 1935 emerged in response to the economic fallout of the Great Depression. Will the current era yield a new—and even more inclusive—social contract? There is no roadmap out of a 21st century pandemic. We do not yet know what the economy will look like at the point in which a vaccine or other development limits the medical risk of COVID-19, nor do we know precisely when that will be. Although we do not yet know the endgame for the current pandemic, history suggests that the threat of COVID-19 will fade long before the enduring effects of systemic racism recede (McCoy, 2020).In a context of pandemic-related uncertainty and failure to meaningfully address racism, we believe that policy prescriptions should address both the economic and social effects of the pandemic and structural racism. The aftermath of 2020 is a time for imagining and building a more sound and just foundation for our country. Social workers and social welfare researchers should promote innovative policy solutions, advance methodologies to center the needs and circumstances of marginalized populations, and—most crucially—continue to ask the questions that define our field's work: Who has power, who is left out, and through what mechanisms? How can we build more inclusive structures? These questions should guide both scholarship and practice.Times of crisis can move policy quickly, and solutions once considered fringe might gain political traction. Social work should support Black Americans' long-ignored call for asset-based reparations (Darity & Mullen, 2020), which could both eliminate the racial wealth gap and spur overall economic growth. We should also continue to explore ideas such as a federal jobs guarantee (Paul et al., 2018), comprehensive child allowances (Shaefer et al., 2018), and universal basic income (Caputo & Lewis, 2016). Following targeted universal design principles (powell et al., 2019) could make such tools both antirecessionary and antiracist. Targeted universalist design calls for a combination of universal goals (e.g., all households have adequate income for basic needs) and population-specific methods (e.g., payments based in part on historic harms) for reaching those goals.Social work should also use more innovative methods to examine social problems and solutions. For example, expanding our use of social media data to access lived-experience narratives inaccessible with traditional data acquisition mechanisms (Rodriguez & Storer, 2020) could lead to better, more scalable interventions. Social work scholars and practitioners, particularly those invested in implementing interventions at scale, would do well to avail themselves of the many advances in computational research methods. These methods allow for the use of vast amounts of unsolicited data, which—when adhering to a high standard of ethical social science research conduct—can advance analysis toward causal claims (Egami et al., 2018). Similarly, communicating research in new ways can help influence decisionmakers. For instance, evaluators of a Stockton, CA, guaranteed income experiment combined participatory action research methods with an online dashboard to display qualitative and quantitative findings that community members deemed important (Martin-West et al., 2019; Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, 2019).Specific solutions and methods are secondary to policy goals, however, and a strength of our field rests in critical policy analysis. One set of questions concerns rights and limits within markets. Will America maintain its prioritization of market solutions as it did with the turn toward neoliberalism in the later decades of the 20th century (Abramovitz, 2012), prioritizing the needs of financial institutions and organized corporate interests over grassroots well-being? Or, will new efforts reset the balance of power within the market, tilting future policies toward enforcing and expanding the rights of those with less power? Our field can analyze how proposed changes to market regulations affect those at the lower rungs of capitalist ladders, including low-paid workers, caregivers, renters, and borrowers. At the same time, we should examine the nature, structure, and effectiveness of collectivist policy responses, ongoing and new. How are federal, state, and local programs and policies changing, and what are the implications of these changes for individual and community well-being?Finally, we should specifically question how well these rules and policies work for those who are marginalized on the basis of their age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexuality, ability, immigration status, class, or intersections of these identities. Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor (2020) wrote about this in her reflection on the intersectional Black feminist theory of the Combahee River Collective of the 1970s, titled \"Until Black Women are Free, None of Us will be Free.\" As Taylor asserted, systems that fail the marginalized will reinforce division and inequality for everyone. Together, demands for collective responses, increasing the influence of the less powerful, and designing policies for full inclusion will move our postpandemic world toward a richer conceptualization of justice in which systems are designed to work for those furthest from full material and social inclusion.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to acknowledge Hamdi Abdi and the employees at the University of Buffalo Early Childhood Research Center for their labor during the preparation of this is a at the University of Washington of Social Y.

          "Accurate models of social processes are invaluable tools for understanding, exploring, explaining, and predicting phenomena that impact decisions about policies and courses of action. However, computational social science (CSS) models today take months to create and can only be generated by a fraction of modeling experts. Building models in this way is an \"Ivory Tower\" approach where highly specialized modelers spend an impractical amount of time building a model, creating \"heavy\" models that are slow to develop, hard to maintain, and may not reflect rapidly changing factors \"on the ground.\" CSS models must be developed more easily and in a more timely fashion to support the dynamicity of the social space. This work describes a vision and proof of concept in which observations of average people are harnessed by a system capable of generating adaptive models that leverage individual and collective insights and experiences. Rather than relying on few experts with similar experiences, our approach relies on a larger crowd of individuals with diverse knowledge. This approach augments the Ivory Tower with the wisdom of crowds to enable speedier development and seamless update and maintenance of models.",
          "The amount of online data in 2016 was estimated at 16 Zetta Bytes (102 1) and is predicted to be 44 ZB by 2020 and 163 ZB by 2025 (The IDe Data Age 2025 report, 2017). The advent of Internet of Things (loT), social data, and usage tracking will continue to contribute to exponential growth in data. In addition to data growth, the number of people connected to the internet by 2020 is expected to reach 4 billion people; half of today' s world population (Search Engine Watch, Sep 2107). Data quality is another major challenge at the content, metadata, standards, and semantic levels making it hard to determine authorship, currency, and content semantics and quality. Aside from this still, content is reduced from ideas to text and reconstructed by humans with different expressiveness and interpretation due to great variance in people (backgrounds, culture, value system, education, personas, etc.) and the context of their situation including stress, urgency, task complexity, etc. What exacerbates finding information online is that people are increasingly relying on search but continue to provide queries that are too short, i.e. less than 3 words, yielding millions of search results that are, with the exception for the first page or two, ignored. Absence of a librarian-like or ask-a-friend human dimension had reduced Information Seeking to Information Retrieval which was proven ineffective in recent decades. Therefore, this work takes a user-centred approach with emphasis on the human role to contribute to page scoring dynamically so that results would reflect happenings of the time and general historic trends of users. In other words, the focus is on what works regardless of the reasons in order to skip human variance complexities. Thus, the target solution is for the general average user not for personalisation. This is done via usage stats and explicit user feedback which are not standardised in today' s web world. Therefore, this work is applicable where these two factors are possible such as at the work place. The findings, though, are general in nature. This research follows the complete cycle of theory, modelling, algorithm translation, and experiment testing. Even if research contributed to knowledge through negative outcomes, back-tracking the challenge to a previous stage is still useful research (e.g. unsuccessful experiment or results > algorithm > model > theory). On the other hand, affirmative results do not necessarily mean acceptance of theory but rather opening another avenue of investigation by testing some other aspect of the theory/model. Either way, theory-driven research provides better context and richer potential for refutation/confirmation, and contribution. The proposed Consensus Theory and relevance judgment Model (CT&M) hypothesise how people might be influenced when making relevance judgment decisions. The proposed ConsensusRank (CR) algorithm is derived to test the model in a real-life web experiment that is open to anyone at any time. Whether CR can predict a new user' s explicit ranking better than CR's base, Google PageRank, is the real test. PageRank inspired CT&M due to the quantity and quality of inlinks. The quality dimension of the model was also influenced by Rieh' s (2002) model of relevance judgment. CT &M adds a quantitative consensus dimension and relates it inversely to Rieh's cognitive dimension. The Ranking Game web experiment provides an open web platform for testing the proposed CT &M theory/model and corresponding CR algorithm. It is based on the August-2016 English Wikipedia corpus (12.7 million pages) with Page View Statistics (PVS) for May, June, and July 2016. The game uses TREC's pooling method to merge top 20 results from major search engines and presents an alphabetic list for users' explicit ranking via drag and drop. The algorithms are: Google PageRank, Google real-time, Yahoo real-time, PVS, StatsRank (SR), ConsensusRank, Real-time meta search, and user ranking consensus. The same platform can be used for controlled experiments and captures implicit data for future research. This research modified Google' s PageRank with two human artefacts: Page View Statistics and explicit user ranking. Both are dynamic factors that reflect the nature of human behaviour and surrounding events of the time. This dynamism solves the known Power Law monopoly of top search results and addresses PageRank' s equal navigation probability assumption which we prove is not a good assumption. These adjustments bring the IS human dimension into IR, a repeatedly sought-after research objective. Furthermore, this is done in a theoretical context that is congruent with established field theories expanded using modern Computational Social Science statistical quantified approaches. Findings show great variability in outlink Page View Stats which disproves PageRank' s uniform navigation assumption. PVS consistent behaviour from month to month provides a good alternative to influence the likelihood of link navigation and further justifies StatsRank as a PageRank variant. Confirmed by the statistical Sign Test, results of typical web search engine tests, NDCG and MAP, affirmatively confirm the hypothesis that ConsensusRank improves over its base PageRank when compared against real-time meta-search from which it is completely independent. The strongest finding is that a new random user ranking is found to consistently correlate best to user ranking consensus, then to ConsensusRank, then to PageRank. The biggest contribution is probably the theoretical one: Consensus Theory and Relevance Judgment Model. This is because theories invite challenges and refutations which lead to field development. Contributions also include the proposed algorithms StatsRank (SR) and ConsensusRank (CR). Although not generally applicable due to the nature of explicit feedback and stats data capture, CR & SR are usable in the business world and do highlight the need to open up this type of data capture. Finally, The Ranking Game open web experiment research platform is one that goes well with theory and research experimentation.",
          "Generative agent simulations offer transformative potential for computational social science (CSS); however, the requirement for sophisticated programming expertise limits their adoption to technical specialists, excluding many domain experts. This paper presents a web-based, open-source platform that democratizes access to the Concordia framework through an intuitive, no-code interface. The system allows researchers to configure, execute, and analyze multi-agent simulations without writing code, bridging the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation. Key technical contributions include a robust reliability layer designed to sustain long-running simulations, incorporating automatic checkpointing and timeout protection to mitigate the external LLM API instability inherent in extended execution times. Additionally, the system features a provider-agnostic adapter supporting both major commercial model APIs and locally hosted models. The platform further streamlines research workflows through configurable game master templates (generic, game-theoretic, questionnaire-based) and automated LLM-powered analysis tools. We evaluate the system across diverse scenarios and discuss the trade-offs between this web interface and the native Concordia Python framework. By eliminating programming barriers while preserving advanced simulation capabilities, this tool serves as both an accessible entry point for non-technical researchers and a rapid prototyping environment for experts.",
          "<title>Abstract</title> Social systems that involve humans as interacting agents are complex due to the massively entangled interactions between the agents and the environment. Social engagement initiatives such as Women’s Empowerment (WE) exemplify a social system actively seeking sophisticated solutions for sharing information, acquiring knowledge, and conducting a comprehensive assessment of its impact on well-informed and effective decision-making. To facilitate this, we propose a Computational Social Science approach to assess WE. This involves integrating computational and data science methodologies into the AWESOME theoretical framework (Accelerating Women’s Empowerment through Systems Model. Despite the existence of valuable digital data, conducting a thorough evaluation of empowerment is challenging due to the variability and heterogene-ity in data source formats and types. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new ontology, AweOnto, tailored to the women’s empowerment domain and anchored in the AWESOME framework. AweOnto serves to bridge the diversity of data sources by establishing relationships between core domain concepts, functioning as an ontological knowledge model. The paper first presents how AweOnto is conceptually modeled based on the existing ontology development methodologies. Next, it discusses the model’s implementation using the protege tool owl format. The paper then demonstrates the usability of AweOnto for its application in information extraction in the form of domain-specific concept detection. The paper discusses the potential of applying ontology for exploring and extracting meta-information from unstructured texts through multi-labeled hierarchical annotations. The resulting annotations in the form of labels/tags are not intended to replace the available keywords but rather provide complimentary detailed information about the different aspects of WE.",
          "This chapter provides an overview of computational communication science (CCS) as an emerging and exemplary subfield of computational social science. Based on lessons from working group sessions with 35 experts, we address recent challenges and desiderata of CCS research while reflecting upon its future development and expansion. Four major fields of action proved particularly relevant in these discussions: First, challenges related to a reflected but integrated CCS methodology; second, challenges related to a further elaboration on the theoretical perspectives on CCS; third, challenges related to the formation and further institutionalization of CCS as fundamental basis for further scientific exchange, progress and standardization; and fourth, implications for empirical communication research, particularly highlighting the relevance of wicked problems as research incubators driving further progress.",

          "In this essay we make four interrelated points. First, we reiterate previous arguments (Kleinberg et al 2015) that forecasting problems are more common in social science than is often appreciated. From this observation it follows that social scientists should care about predictive accuracy in addition to unbiased or consistent estimation of causal relationships. Second, we argue that social scientists should be interested in prediction even if they have no interest in forecasting per se. Whether they do so explicitly or not, that is, causal claims necessarily make predictions; thus it is both fair and arguably useful to hold them accountable for the accuracy of the predictions they make. Third, we argue that prediction, used in either of the above two senses, is a useful metric for quantifying progress. Important differences between social science explanations and machine learning algorithms notwithstanding, social scientists can still learn from approaches like the Common Task Framework (CTF) which have successfully driven progress in certain fields of AI over the past 30 years (Donoho, 2015). Finally, we anticipate that as the predictive performance of forecasting models and explanations alike receives more attention, it will become clear that it is subject to some upper limit which lies well below deterministic accuracy for many applications of interest (Martin et al 2016). Characterizing the properties of complex social systems that lead to higher or lower predictive limits therefore poses an interesting challenge for computational social science.",
          "A key challenge of data-driven social science is the gathering of high quality multi-dimensional datasets. A second challenge relates to the design and execution of social experiments in the real world that are as reliable as those within a controlled laboratory, yet yield more practical results. We introduce the Functional Mechanism-design and Relationship Imaging, or Social - an approach that enhances existing computational social science methodologies by bridging rich data collection strategies with experimental interventions. _x000D_\nIn this thesis, we demonstrate the value of the fMRI approach in our Friends and Family study. We transformed a young-family residential community into a living laboratory for 15 months, through a very fine-grained and longitudinal data collection process combined with targeted experimental interventions. Through the derived dataset of unprecedented quality, the fMRI approach allows us to gain insights into intricate social mechanisms and interpersonal relationships within the community in ways not previously possible. _x000D_\nThis thesis delivers the following contributions: (1) A methodology combining a rich-data experimental approach together with carefully designed interventions, (2) a system supporting the methodology - implemented, field-tested, and released to the world as an open-source framework with a growing community of users, (3) a dataset collected using the system, comprising what is, to date, the richest real-world dataset of its genre, (4) a very large set of experimental findings that contribute to our understanding of important research questions in computational social science in addition to demonstrating the methodology's potential. Among the results described in this thesis are the design and evaluation of a novel mechanism for social support in a health-related context, the observation that the diffusion of mobile applications relies more on the face-to-face interaction ties than on self-perceived friendship ties, and a gained understanding of the evolution of modeling and prediction processes over time and varying sample sizes.

          "The chapter narrows the scope of computational social science (CSS) to the intersection of data science and social science. It reviews current perspectives on CSS methodology and discusses causal and predictive inference as its main objectives. The chapter highlights causal inference as part of the counterfactual model for observational data analysis, discusses major threats to the validity of inference in CSS, and draws particular attention to validation through proving the replicability of results. The chapter discusses this principle as practiced in data science to extend this training/test sample comparison to the replicability of results across the outcomes of decisions to be made in the conceptualization, modeling, and validation steps of research. The chapter covers a case study of political extremism that uses pooled data from rounds 1 to 9 of the European Social Survey to exemplify the merits of combining causal inference with the generalized idea of replication in data science.",
          "Methods for analyzing neural and computational social science data are usually used by different types of scientists and generally seen as distinct, but they strongly complement one another. Computational social science methodologies can strengthen and contextualize individual-level analysis, specifically our understanding of the brain. Neuroscience can help to unpack the mechanisms that lead from micro- through meso- to macro-level observations. Integrating levels of analysis is essential to unified progress in social research. We present two example areas that illustrate this integration. First, combining egocentric social network data with neural variables from the “egos” provides insight about why and for whom certain types of antismoking messages may be more or less effective. Second, combining tools from natural language processing with neuroimaging reveals mechanisms involved in successful message propagation, and suggests links from microscopic to macroscopic scales.",

          "Underlying complex systems, there is a rich web of interconnected components that determine the relational properties of the system. Yet, traditional methods used in education sciences often disregard the underlying complexity of the educational system and, consequently, its emergence phenomena. Here, we argue that an interconnected vision of educational systems -- from classrooms to an organizational level -- is key to improving learning, social integration, well-being, and decision making, all fundamental aspects of the educational experience. Understanding the education system as an interconnected network of people, degree programs, and institutions requires methods and concepts from computational social sciences. Thus, we can leverage institutional records and (quasi) experimental designs to elicit the relational maps of key players in education and derive their implications in their functioning at all scales. In different settings, from elementary classrooms to higher education programs, we show how mapping the network relationships between entities can lead to the inference of novel insights about education systems and the development of solutions with societal implications.",
          "In this talk, I explain why I believe that computational social science and (online) open data can expose, reproduce, and transpose (offline) infrastructural inequalities related to disability. To make this point, I draw on the first phase of a multi-stage, mixed methods research project that centres around a “public washrooms” dataset released by the City of Vancouver. I discuss how, in this case, open data can: be used to expose gaps in infrastructural services for wheelchair users; reproduce disableism by providing misleading or inaccurate data, and; transpose disableism from (offline) infrastructural and resource deficits into (online) informational deficits, which then also influence (offline) engagement with urban environments.",
          "Early social informatics research focused primarily on ethnographic and site-specific observations or was based on limited discourse analysis involving smaller case studies. However, in the last decade, the rise of social media has provided access to large-scale data and made the observation of interaction between people and technologies easier. This trend has informed social informatics perspectives for examining the roles and impacts of social media in our work and social lives. For a number of years now, researchers in social informatics have been concerned about expanding the theoretical depth and richness of the discipline (Sanfilippo and Fichman, 2014; Sawyer and Tyworth, 2006). As studies of social media continue to gain in popularity and move from descriptive to more analytical approaches, researchers are likely to begin to critically reflect on what they are doing and finding and to therefore provide insights into theoretical aspects of social informatics research. By discussing their research and drawing implications for extending the conceptual and theoretical boundaries of social informatics, the panelists will engage with the above question. They come from a variety of backgrounds and study a range of social media from a variety of perspectives. Given that these scholars all take critical approaches to the questions that drive their work, we expect a lively and interactive session as the panelists raise provocative issues and questions about the ways in which their work impacts and has implications for social informatics theory. In doing so, the panelists will also push the boundaries in ways that broaden the original conception of social informatics. With this panel we hope to attract participants who are new to or unfamiliar with the community of social informatics scholars. The panelists will present various perspectives on the theoretical advancement of social informatics research by using individual studies on social media. Kenneth R. Fleischmann will offer an insight that technology designs, especially social media design, are affected by human values. Mohammad Hossein Jarrahi will describe his research on knowledge sharing using social media. Brian Butler will use his research on social media to illustrate how transformational perspective and the large amount of data set contribute to our better understanding of social informatics. Howard Rosenbaum will provide an introduction that will set the context for the panel. Pnina Fichman and Noriko Hara will moderate the panel discussions. Building on his recent monograph, Information and Human Values, as well as his chapter, “Social Informatics, Human Values, and ICT Design,” in Social Informatics: Past, Present, and Future, (edited by Fichman and Rosenbaum), Fleischmann will discuss how human values influence social media design and use from a social informatics perspective. Specifically, he will explore how Rob Kling's research set the stage for values and design research, and how fully embracing values and design research can help to keep social informatics current and relevant. The emphasis on human values allows for building on various rich intellectual traditions across the social sciences, while the emphasis on design helps the research to have practical impact. Butler will discuss how the amount of data available in social media helps our understanding of social informatics. Social media makes social aspects of information visible, recordable, accessible, and measurable. Whether researchers apply qualitative or quantitative methods, social media provide rich opportunities to develop, describe, and test our theories, concepts, and explanations of social informatics in ways that previously were impractical. In addition, he believes that, while social informatics has taken a big picture view on information and related phenomena, there remains a strong tendency to return to documents, transactions, and individuals as the units of analysis (either empirical or conceptual). Social media challenges us to step up our game and develop theories, concepts, frameworks, measures that can explain larger scale phenomena – and develop these intellectual constructs in such a way that they are accessible and useful not just for scholars but also for the practitioners who (because of social media) are now aware of the larger scale – but often lack frameworks they need to communicate, discuss, and take action. Jarrahi will discuss a study of multiple forms of social technologies and their potential for informal knowledge sharing practices in organizational context. Building from the theoretical lenses of sociomateriality, structuration, and technological frames, the findings from this project advance our understanding of: (1) the ways in which social technologies are used in combination as a suite of tools, (2) the ways in which organizational norms, policies, and arrangements shape the uses of social technologies for knowledge practices, and (3) the variations in uses of social technologies by different groups of knowledge workers.

          "The usefulness of research infrastructures (RIs) for digital humanities (DH) and computational social sciences (CSS) depends on their capability to support research work tasks. RIs can provide more effective support and services when they have a clear understanding of the work practices and specific tasks researchers are engaged in. This paper explores the ways of working of social sciences and humanities (SSH) scholars to develop resources that truly endorse their data-intensive research processes. Particularly, the study investigates how SSH scholars interact with digital tools and materials to both determine their information needs and how to better support them. A qualitative analysis of 21 semi-structured interviews with potential end-users of a national RI for the DH and CSS that is currently under development revealed three themes: digitizing SSH research, meeting the information needs related to DH/CSS, and supporting DH/CSS research. Based on our findings, we were able to create an understanding of the work task-based requirements of SSH scholars that can be used to inform designs for improved RIs. Suggestions for enhancing the sustainability of resources and services in SSH are also put forth, emphasizing the importance of understanding and accommodating the unique scholarly practices within these fields.",

          "<title>Abstract</title> Measurement of public opinion and consensus faces unprecedented challenges in the digital age, where attitudes are increasingly expressed as complex, multidimensional constructs rather than simple binary positions. Traditional analytical approaches based on sentiment analysis or unidimensional variance measures prove inadequate for capturing the nuanced relationships between different dimensions of opinion in these complex spaces. This study proposes a novel statistical framework for measuring consensus based on principles from multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and distance metrics in multidimensional Euclidean space. The methodology applies this model to a comprehensive dataset of Twitter discourse concerning COVID-19 vaccination, utilizing both topic modeling and transformer-based embeddings to represent opinions in high-dimensional spaces. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in quantifying consensus on a continuous scale from 0 to 1, revealing that online discussions frequently maintain multipolar opinion structures rather than trending toward either complete consensus or polarization. Furthermore, we identify strong correlations between network properties—particularly community structure and density—and internal consensus levels within subcommunities. The proposed Consensus Index provides a powerful quantitative tool for analyzing opinion dynamics in complex spaces, with significant applications in computational social science, social media marketing, and polarization research.",

          "The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary 2015 (LIWC2015) is a standard text analysis dictionary that quantifies the linguistic and psychometric properties of English words. A Japanese version of the LIWC2015 dictionary (J-LIWC2015) has been expected in the fields of natural language processing and cross-cultural research. This study aims to create the J-LIWC2015 through systematic investigations of the original dictionary and Japanese corpora. The entire LIWC2015 dictionary was initially subjected to human and machine translation into Japanese. After verifying the frequency of use of the words in large corpora, frequent words and phrases that are unique to Japanese were added to the dictionary, followed by recategorization by psychologists. The updated dictionary indicated good internal consistency, semantic equivalence with the original LIWC2015 dictionary, and good construct validity in each category. The evidence suggests that the J-LIWC2015 dictionary is a powerful research tool in computational social science to scrutinize the psychological processes behind Japanese texts and promote standardized cross-cultural investigations in combination with LIWC dictionaries in different languages.",

          "Abstract The emergence of Computational Social Science (CSS) marks a transformative shift in the study of social phenomena, triggered by advancements in computational technology and large-scale collection of (digital) behavioral trace data. CSS promises to provide an accurate and deep understanding of social behavior through the analysis of social interactions, movement patterns, and communication networks at scale. However, the lack of a common theoretical language and clearly defined scientific agenda complicates CSS’ ability to build a common understanding of social phenomena. In this chapter, we establish CSS as a scientific paradigm, emphasizing the integration of computational tools with rigorous theoretical modeling. Specifically, we position CSS within the trajectory of a maturing science and emphasize the synthesis of data-driven CSS with theoretically-informed modeling for understanding social phenomena like social cohesion and polarization. To illustrate how CSS can advance these fields specifically, we unpack a range of conceptualizations of political polarization and social cohesion, and demonstrate how they have evolved in Europe over recent decades. Finally, we discuss how the subsequent chapters in this book aim to bridge the gap between theoretical and empirical CSS for social cohesion and polarization.",
          "Organizations are transforming as they adopt new technologies and use new sources of data, changing the experiences of employees and pushing organizational researchers to respond. As employees perform their daily activities, they generate vast digital data. These data, when combined with established methods and new analytic techniques, create unprecedented opportunities for studying human behavior at work and have fueled the rise of people analytics as a new institutional field of practice. In this chapter, I describe the emerging field of people analytics and new organizational phenomena that accompany the use of data and algorithms. These practices are affecting how individuals, groups, and organizations function, ranging from decision-making processes and work procedures, to communication and collaboration, to attempts to monitor and control employees. In each of these domains, I describe recent research and propose new research directions. Many of these domains intersect with the emerging field of Computational Social Science, in which disciplinary scholars are applying computational methods to an expanding array of digitized data, pursuing interests that extend far into the organizational domain. Organizational scholars are well-positioned to bridge organizational and disciplinary advances to stay at the forefront of research on the future of work.",
          "Researchers often face the problem of needing to protect the privacy of subjects while also needing to integrate data that contains personal information from diverse data sources. The advent of computational social science and the enormous amount of data about people that is being collected makes protecting the privacy of research subjects ever more important. However, strict privacy procedures can hinder the process of joining diverse sources of data that contain information about specific individual behaviors. In this paper we present a procedure to keep information about specific individuals from being \"leaked\" or shared in either direction between two sources of data without need of a trusted third party. To achieve this goal, we randomly assign individuals to anonymous groups before combining the anonymized information between the two sources of data. We refer to this method as the Yahtzee procedure, and show that it performs as predicted by theoretical analysis when we apply it to data from Facebook and public voter records.",
          "Emergency services and utilities need appropriate planning tools to analyze and improve infrastructure and community resilience to disasters. Recognized as a key metric of community resilience is the social well-being of a community during a disaster, which is made up of mental and physical social health. Other factors influencing community resilience directly or indirectly are emotional health, emergency services, and the availability of critical infrastructures services, such as food, agriculture, water, transportation, electric power, and communications system. It turns out that in computational social science literature dealing with community resilience, the role of these critical infrastructures along with some important social characteristics is not considered. To address these weaknesses, we develop a new multi-agent based stochastic dynamical model, standardized by overview, design concepts, details, and decision (ODD+D) protocol and derived from neuro-science, psychological and social sciences, to measure community resilience in terms of mental and physical well-being. Using this model, we analyze the micro-macro level dependence between the emergency services and power systems and social characteristics such as fear, risk perception, information-seeking behaviour, cooperation, flexibility, empathy, and experience, in an artificial society. Furthermore, we simulate this model in two case studies and show that a high level of flexibility, experience, and cooperation enhances community resilience. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed.",
          "Abstract. In the last few years, the study of social phenomena has hosted a renewal of interest in Computational Social Science (CSS). While this field is not new – Axelrod’s first computational work on the evolution of cooperation goes back to 1981 – CSS has recently resurged under the pressure of quantitative social science and the application of Big Data analytics to social datasets. However, Big Data is no panacea and the data deluge that it provides raises more questions than it answers. The aim of this paper is to present an overview in which CSS will be introduced and the costs of CSS will be balanced against its benefits, in an attempt to propose an integrative view of the new and the old practice of CSS. In particular, two routes to integration will be drawn. First, it will be advocated that social data mining and computational modeling need to be integrated. Second, we will introduce the generative approach, aimed to understand how social phenomena can be generated starting from the micro-components, including psychological mechanisms, and we will discuss the necessity of combining it with the anticipatory, data-driven objective. By these means, Computational Social Science will develop into a more comprehensive field of Computational Social and Behavioral Science in which data science, ICT, as well as the behavioral and social sciences will be fruitfully integrated.",

          "The explosive growth of social media has not only revolutionized communication but also brought challenges such as political polarization, misinformation, hate speech, and echo chambers. This dissertation employs computational social science techniques to investigate these issues, understand the social dynamics driving negative online behaviors, and propose data-driven solutions for healthier digital interactions. I begin by introducing a scalable social network representation learning method that integrates user-generated content with social connections to create unified user embeddings, enabling accurate prediction and visualization of user attributes, communities, and behavioral propensities. Using this tool, I explore three interrelated problems: 1) COVID-19 discourse on Twitter, revealing polarization and asymmetric political echo chambers; 2) online hate speech, suggesting the pursuit of social approval motivates toxic behavior; and 3) moral underpinnings of COVID-19 discussions, uncovering patterns of moral homophily and echo chambers, while also indicating moral diversity and plurality can improve message reach and acceptance across ideological divides. These findings contribute to the advancement of computational social science and provide a foundation for understanding human behavior through the lens of social interactions and network homophily.",

          "Generative AI changes the paradigm of natural language processing research, sets off a new trend of research in computational humanities and computational social sciences, and provides unique perspectives on digital intelligence-enabled ancient book revitalization and intelligent applications. The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.",
          "Abstract Powered by better hardware and software, and fueled by the emergence of computational social science, digital traces of human activity can be used to make highly personal inferences about their owner’s preferences, habits and psychological characteristics. The gained insights allow the application of psychological targeting and make it possible to influence the behavior of large groups of people by tailoring persuasive appeals to the psychological needs of the target audiences. On the one hand, this method holds potential benefits for helping individuals make better decisions and lead healthier and happier lives. On the other hand, there are also several potential pitfalls related to manipulation, data protection and privacy violations. Even the most progressive data protection regulations of today might not adequately address the potential abuse of online information in the context of psychological targeting, highlighting the need for further policy interventions and regulations.",
          "AbstractWeb archives are not direct traces of the web, they are direct traces of crawlers. By design, the structure of web archives limits our capacity to explore the memory of the Web. These structural issues induce temporal discontinuities such as inconsistency, redundancy and blindness. In this paper, we address the question of re-injecting continuity within large corpora of web archives. We introduce the notions of persistences (series of time-stable snapshots of archived web pages) and continuity spaces (networks of time-consistent persistences). We demonstrate how – on the basis of a quality score – persistences can be used to select subsets of web archives within which in-depth historical analysis can be conducted at scale. We next propose to make use of a new visualization approach called web cernes to reconstruct the multi-level temporal evolution of an archived community of web sites. We finally apply our framework to study the history of the firsttuesday movement: a constellation of entrepreneurial web sites that acted in the interest of the economical growth of the web in the early 2000s.Keywords: Web archivediscontinuitypersistencephylomemyweb cernecontinuity spacefirsttuesday AcknowledgementsI would first like to thank Y.

          "This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams, expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital humanities and socially-aware computing systems.",
          "From Trump’s election campaign on X (Twitter) to the mobilizations of independence movements on Facebook, many nationalist phenomena have developed an important digital aspect. While the digitalisation of nationalism has provided nationalism researchers with an unprecedented amount of digital information, the massive volume of these data often makes many traditional research methods infeasible. Against this background, computational methods offer viable options to analyse a large volume of data in an efficient way. In this article, I will offer a brief summary of works that employed computational social science methods for the study of nationalism and give an account of what computational social science methods can contribute to nationalism studies. I will end this article with a discussion of the best practices for computational nationalism research.",

          "Abstract This study analyzes Turkey’s political landscape by harnessing computational social science techniques to parse extensive data about public ideologies from the Politus database. Unlike existing theoretical frameworks that focus on the ideologies of political elites and cadres, this study examines public ideologies in a contentious political manner. Exploiting an artificial intelligence-based data generation pipeline on digital traces, it distills the eight most prevalent ideologies down to the city level and employs exploratory statistical analyses. Principal component analysis delineates two fundamental axes: the traditional left–right political spectrum and a separate spectrum of secular–religious inclination, encompassing both political and cultural dimensions. Then, cluster analysis reveals three distinct groups: left-leaning and religiously inclined; center-right-leaning and religiously inclined; and those with a center-right-leaning focus and a pronounced secular orientation. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the political and cultural axes within political society, offering a clearer understanding of the most recent ideological and political climate in Turkey.",

          "Abstract Purpose Social media users share their ideas, thoughts, and emotions with other users. However, it is not clear how online users would respond to new research outcomes. This study aims to predict the nature of the emotions expressed by Twitter users toward scientific publications. Additionally, we investigate what features of the research articles help in such prediction. Identifying the sentiments of research articles on social media will help scientists gauge a new societal impact of their research articles. Design/methodology/approach Several tools are used for sentiment analysis, so we applied five sentiment analysis tools to check which are suitable for capturing a tweet's sentiment value and decided to use NLTK VADER and TextBlob. We segregated the sentiment value into negative, positive, and neutral. We measure the mean and median of tweets’ sentiment value for research articles with more than one tweet. We next built machine learning models to predict the sentiments of tweets related to scientific publications and investigated the essential features that controlled the prediction models. Findings We found that the most important feature in all the models was the sentiment of the research article title followed by the author count. We observed that the tree-based models performed better than other classification models, with Random Forest achieving 89% accuracy for binary classification and 73% accuracy for three-label classification. Research limitations In this research, we used state-of-the-art sentiment analysis libraries. However, these libraries might vary at times in their sentiment prediction behavior. Tweet sentiment may be influenced by a multitude of circumstances and is not always immediately tied to the paper's details. In the future, we intend to broaden the scope of our research by employing word2vec models. Practical implications Many studies have focused on understanding the impact of science on scientists or how science communicators can improve their outcomes. Research in this area has relied on fewer and more limited measures, such as citations and user studies with small datasets. There is currently a critical need to find novel methods to quantify and evaluate the broader impact of research. This study will help scientists better comprehend the emotional impact of their work. Additionally, the value of understanding the public's interest and reactions helps science communicators identify effective ways to engage with the public and build positive connections between scientific communities and the public. Originality/value This study will extend work on public engagement with science, sociology of science, and computational social science. It will enable researchers to identify areas in which there is a gap between public and expert understanding and provide strategies by which this gap can be bridged.",
          "The digital evolution of economies and markets brings changes that go largely beyond growth and efficiency. In the gig economy, also fueled by algorithmic management solutions, digital labour platforms (DPLs) raise significant issues that include power asymmetries, new forms of workers' abuse and discrimination, algorithms' opacity and over-control. In such a scenario, while normative frameworks evolve novel safeguards, a crucial challenge is that of feeding public (social, institutional) oversight on the dynamics that, at various levels, affect the gig work world. In this paper, we show how the combination of visual analytics and data-driven heuristics can be used to offer new insights on and promote higher levels of transparency and awareness about the fairness of DPLs' activity seen, in the first place, from the workers' perspective. Solutions will be presented as part of GigAdvisor, an experimental cross-platform application developed within an ongoing research that draws on computational social science methods to enable new critical approaches to the digital economy.",
          "The problems of developing and applying methods for collecting and processing marketing data using modern computational methods and tools to address theoretical and methodological issues in digital marketing have been examined. The prerequisites for marketing methodology development as a scientific field in the transition to Industry 4.0 have been analyzed. The essence of computational social science and reasons for its emergence in social sciences development context have been revealed. The feasibility of applying computational methods in marketing research for forming a new system of marketing knowledge corresponding to current digital marketing environment development has been substantiated. The advantages of using computational methods for digital marketing development have been identified. Structural changes in the methodological component during transition to the new marketing paradigm have been revealed. It has been demonstrated that the paradigm shift from traditional to digital marketing has been driven by Industry 4.0 technological breakthroughs (Big Data, Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence), which revolutionized marketing research by enabling human exchanges study through digital technologies. Traditional methods based on logical empiricism have been gradually supplemented with computational methods from social sciences. Computational advertising research has been established as a key component of digital marketing studies, focusing on automated advertising campaigns using computer science, economics, mathematical modeling, and behavioral psychology methods. The integrated methodological toolkit combining traditional and computational research methods has been formed as the digital marketing paradigm foundation, enabling scientists to effectively process and analyze digital marketing data. It has been concluded that this will enable preparing a new generation of marketing scientists capable of using computational methods systematically and creating new scientific traditions for such research.",
          "The scope of the research presented in this thesis is fairly broad, touching upon areas like social network analysis, information and behavioral contagion models, and social data science. As the world becomes increasingly digitalized, it becomes crucial to better understand interactions in the digital sphere. The proliferation of online communication allows interaction between people with more diverse backgrounds more varied areas of knowledge than before. However while increased digitalization carries the potential for an explosion of diversity in communication, that is far from the only conceivable consequence. The same diversity oﬀers anyone online a multitude of diﬀerent communities and sources of information. This carries the risk of individuals choosing disproportionately often to connect to individuals that are similar to themselves, and to consume exclusively information which supports their preexisting convictions. Fortunately ﬁelds such as network science, computational social science, and machine learning are developing rapidly, and an increasing amount of interest is being taking in understanding online interactions. The common theme for the research on which this thesis builds, is a preoccupancy with the aforementioned aspects of online behavior. The reseach includes work on quantitative modeling of information ﬂows in social systems, attention dynamics/economics models, techniques for analysis of polarized discourse/echo chambers, and the inﬂuence of language on collective behavior.",
          "Digitization led to an enormous increase in the availability of visual data. As images are an important aspect of human communication, decades of social science research have analysed images, yet in mostly manual fashion with limited scaling capacities. In this work, we outline how recent advances in computer vision enable automated image analysis, allowing researchers to further unlock the potential of digital behavioural data. We introduce the field of computational social science and conduct a literature review of early studies using image recognition. We also highlight important aspects to be considered, such as computational demands and biases of computer vision models. Furthermore, in a case study, we examine the online behaviour of U.S. Members of Congress during the early COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In particular, we focus on sharing images showing face masks as they are a crucial aspect of health and safety measures during the pandemic. Using Instagram data and models for detecting face masks, we find that temporal dynamics and party affiliation play a substantial role in the likelihood of sharing images of people wearing face masks: images with masks are more often posted after the introduction of mask mandates and Democratic party members are more likely to share images with masks. In addition, we find somewhat weaker to no differences regarding the age and gender of politicians.",
          "Social computing is ubiquitous and intensifying in the 21st Century. Originally used to reference computational augmentation of social interaction through collaborative filtering, social media, wikis, and crowdsourcing, here I propose to expand the concept to cover the complete dynamic interface between social interaction and computation, including computationally enhanced sociality and social science, socially enhanced computing and computer science, and their increasingly complex combination for mutual enhancement. This recommends that we reimagine Computational Social Science as Social Computing, not merely using computational tools to make sense of the contemporary explosion of social data, but also recognizing societies as emergent computers of more or less collective intelligence, innovation and flourishing. It further proposes we imagine a socially inspired computer science that takes these insights into account as we build machines not merely to substitute for human cognition, but radically complement it. This leads to a vision of social computing as an extreme form of human computer interaction, whereby machines and persons recursively combine to augment one another in generating collective intelligence, enhanced knowledge, and other social goods unattainable without each other. Using the example of science and technology, I illustrate how progress in each of these areas unleash advances in the others and the beneficial relationship between the technology and science of social computing, which reveals limits of sociality and computation, and stimulates our imagination about how they can reach past those limits together.",
          "In order to reconstruct the relationship between text and space in the tradition of Chinese classical narrative literature, a Time–Space-time–Space framework of digital models is posited, integrating spatial narrative theories and methods from literary cartography, computational narratology and geo-narrative. This Time–Space-time–Space framework enables varied structured semantics (including the spatio-temporal information) derived from the novel’s text and its necessary historic context semi-manually, as the lack of mature natural language processing tools for ancient Chinese. These value-added structured semantics are then extracted and fused to map the instantaneous spatial pattern perceived by readers in the flow of reading time through data visualization, computational social science and spatial analysis. The organized spatio-temporal representations of narrative literature can help re-understand the narrative and the place. The Time–Space-time–Space framework embeds linearity, experience and significance of the narrative in an open and dialogic field.",
          "Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has triggered Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. In this case study, we investigate the prevalence and types of anti-refugee discourse about Ukrainian refugees on Twitter. Previous studies primarily focused on public discourse and attitudes toward racialized refugees and immigrants; the Ukrainian refugee crisis is unique in that it is one of the few instances of a recent refugee crisis involving people who do not come from mostly racialized communities. Using Communalytic, a computational social science tool for studying public discourse on social media, we automatically collected and identified toxic posts mentioning Ukrainian refugees during the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We focused on posts containing toxic language, as this is where we are most likely to find examples of anti-refugee sentiments. Based on a manual analysis of 2,045 toxic posts referencing Ukrainian refugees, the most prevalent ones were politically motivated and included partisan content (33 percent), followed by posts containing expressions countering anti-refugee narratives (20 percent). These findings highlight the escalating politicization and polarization of discussions about Ukrainian refugees both online and offline. Furthermore, 53 percent of the sample aligned with pro-Kremlin narratives against Ukraine. By exploiting anti-refugee sentiments and leveraging existing political and cultural fault lines in the West, pro-Kremlin messages on Twitter contribute to diminishing support for Ukrainian refugees, minimizing the severity of the war, and undermining international support for Ukraine.",
          "The use of computational methods in the Social Sciences has many roots. Classic examples include the fitting of measurement-, as well as structural models or the recognition of simulation as a third way of doing science. More recently, the availability of large organic datasets has led to the emergence of Computational Social Science. All these examples have in common that potentially compute-intensive and complex analysis pipelines are an essential part of the research. Reproducibility is the cornerstone of modern science. Yet more work is needed to make reproducibility the norm for complex computational analysis pipelines. GESIS Notebooks aims to close this gap in the Social Sciences by supporting reproducible computational analysis pipelines that enable researchers to focus on the methodological aspects of their work while increasing their visibility and following best open-science practices simultaneously. The service does not try to reinvent the wheel but reuses existing technology whenever possible. Execution, place, and content are the concepts of the service, and in the remainder, we will look at each of them.",
          "Experiments are the gold standard for establishing causal relationships. While Web-based experiments (\"A/B tests\") have routinely been used to assess alternative ranking models or user interface designs, they have become increasingly popular for answering important questions in the social sciences. This tutorial teaches attendees how to design, plan, implement, and analyze online experiments. First, we review basic concepts in causal inference and motivate the need for experiments. Then we will discuss basic statistical tools to help plan experiments: exploratory analysis, power calculations, and the use of simulation in R. We then discuss statistical methods to estimate causal quantities of interest and construct appropriate confidence intervals. We then discuss how to design and implement online experiments using PlanOut, an open-source toolkit for advanced online experimentation used at Facebook. We will show how to implement a variety of experiments, including basic A/B tests, within-subjects designs, as well as more sophisticated experiments. We demonstrate how experimental designs from social computing literature can be implemented, and then collaboratively plan and implement an experiment together. We then discuss issues with logging and common errors in the deployment and analysis of experiments. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a discussion of strategies and scalable methods for analyzing online experiments, including working with weighted data, and data with single and multi-way dependence. Throughout the tutorial, attendees will be given code examples and participate in the planning, implementation, and analysis of a Web application using Python, PlanOut, and R.",
          "Social evaluation, i.e., people's views of self, others, and groups, is ubiquitous and embedded in our language. In turn, social evaluative words are used intensively in studies of human social evaluation. However, standardized Chinese word lists for social evaluation are under-developed; the only available word lists are based on the big-two model of social evaluation (i.e., agency and warmth) and cover small numbers of words. To fill the gap, we conducted a survey with a relatively large sample (n = 1270, 50% female) and a large number of words (1908) that might describe extended social evaluative dimensions: appearance, socioeconomic status, sociability, competence, and morality. The participants rated the extent to which each word described a certain social evaluation dimension and how positive/negative each word was. Based on this dataset, we selected words that dominantly describe one of the five above-mentioned dimensions. The final word list has 1040 words, including 245 appearance words (143 positive, 11 neutral, 91 negative), 108 socioeconomic status words (36 positive, 2 neutral, 70 negative), 93 sociability words (53 positive, 5 neutral, 35 negative), 261 competence words (185 positive, 4 neutral, 72 negative), and 333 morality words (149 positive, 1 neutral, 183 negative). This word list provides an extended Chinese social evaluative word list and will serve as a useful resource for researchers in social psychology, linguistics, sociology, and computational social science.",
          "This report surveys and systematizes the emerging field of topological methods for discourse analysis and large language models. It proposes that the “shape” of discourse—its holes, loops, voids, and hierarchies—carries as much signal as lexical or embedding-based similarity. Building on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), the text constructs discourse as simplicial complexes and examines homological invariants such as Betti numbers to detect narrative tie-backs, structural gaps, and multi-threaded literary cavities. Persistent homology and the SIFTS algorithm are used to recover temporal “time skeletons” and quantify narrative regimes in both individual documents and public media streams. The report then turns to sheaf theory as a language for opinion dynamics, modeling the distinction between private belief spaces and public discourse along network edges, and using sheaf cohomology to characterize global consensus, polarization, and “learning to lie” as topological obstructions. Hyperbolic geometry is introduced as the natural embedding space for hierarchical discourse structures such as Rhetorical Structure Theory trees, enabling compact Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings and hyperbolic graph neural networks that preserve tree-like expansion. Finally, the work synthesizes these ingredients in the context of foundation models via Stochastic Topological Memory Embeddings (STME). Here, LLM memory is augmented with persistent homology features and topological signatures that stabilize long-range narrative coherence, enable “wormhole” connections between distant contexts, and exhibit resilience under synthetic perturbations. Across these layers—homology, sheaves, hyperbolic embeddings, and topological memory—the report argues for “topological priors” as a missing structural backbone for discourse-aware AI systems and computational social science.",
          "Introduction This article investigates the evolving landscape of diplomacy in the digital age, focusing on diplomats at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York. The central inquiry revolves around how diplomatic actors use digital tools to complement or augment traditional face-to-face diplomacy. Methods We systematically compare a substantial corpus of X posts (tweets) from UN diplomats with their public statements at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), employing advanced computational social science techniques. This study applies a range of large-scale text analysis methods, including word embedding, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, to investigate systematic differences between offline and online communication. Results Our analysis reveals that, while the essence of diplomacy remains consistent across both domains, there is strategic selectivity in the use of online platforms by diplomats. Online communication emphasizes non-security topics, ceremonial matters, and prominent policy stances, in contrast to the operational issues common in UNSC deliberations. Additionally, online discourse adopts a less confrontational, more public diplomacy-oriented tone, with variations among countries. Discussion This study offers one of the first systematic comparisons between offline and online diplomatic messages. It illuminates how diplomats navigate the digital realm to complement traditional roles. The findings indicate that some elements of public diplomacy and nation branding, directed toward a wider audience far beyond the council chamber, have become an integral part of multilateral diplomacy unfolding at the UNSC.",
          "Starting in June 1944, 11 concentration camps were erected in the Landsberg/Kaufering region (about 60 kilometers west of Munich). The camps all were named Kaufering with a number and were satellite camps of Dachau. Until the end of the war 23,500 almost exclusively Jewish prisoners were forced to work on three huge construction sites for aircraft production facilities (project “Ringeltaube”). More than 6,500 people died in these camps; 3,500 people which were unable to work anymore were transported to Auschwitz and other camps and were mostly murdered immediately. The Kaufering concentration camps were freed on April 27, 1945. The Visual History Archive of the USC Shoa Foundation has 591 Interviews of Holocaust survivors who mention Kaufering in their interviews. As part of the seminar “Computational Social Science” at the Bavarian School of Public Policy at the Technical University of Munich (Winter Semester 2019/20) 25 students transcribed parts of a total of 234 of these interviews. The students were asked to transcribe the interview parts that include accounts about the concentration camps in Kaufering. Interviews were transcribed in seven languages (88% English). Overall 276,126 words have been transcribed. During class, the transcribed interviews were used for text analytical studies.",
          "The article is devoted to the study of the mechanisms of action of the technological factor in the production of goods of intensive renewal. The influence of this factor manifests itself both at the stage of production and promotion of such goods, and in changes in consumption patterns in modern society. Depending on the degree of realization of the industry's potential for technologization, technological polarization of the production of goods of intensive renewal is formed. The trend towards technologization of production and promotion of goods is accompanied by an increase in the degree and diversity of inter-sectoral cooperation, including in the form of collaborations with representatives of the information technology, nanoindustry, computational social science, etc. All this contributes to the realization of the innovative potential of traditional sectors of the economy.",
          "A comprehensive review of 1985–2019 trends related to the (English) term social informatics was conducted for scholarly literature, research and educational institutions, conferences, journals, blogs, and presentations at the International Conference on Social Informatics. The bibliographic search yielded 275 scientific documents with the term social informatics in the title, abstract, or keywords; which were coded according to ten characteristics. The analysis showed that corresponding scientific publications peaked in 2005–2009 and then roughly stagnated. At the same time, they increasingly spread worldwide, with most authors still referring to the concept of social informatics developed by Rob Kling. Other activities related to social informatics were mostly stagnant or slightly declining after 2010–2014, except for the number of educational courses. In contrast, the widespread general use of the term social informatics grew rapidly, especially in the context of computational social science. This is most evident in the analysis of 476 papers from the proceedings of International Conference on Social Informatics (2009–2019), which revealed a very weak identification with the notion of social informatics. Considering these findings, the prospects of social informatics are discussed in a broader context.",

          "“Wicked” problems like climate change, food insecurity, and poverty are difficult to understand and manage, as the socio-environmental systems that produce them are rife with uncertainty, complexity, and counterintuitive dynamics. We are often faced with the reality of making important decisions in data-sparse environments while balancing trade-offs and stakeholders with different, and frequently conflicting, priorities. This dissertation studies how community-engaged research, and more specifically semi-quantitative participatory modeling, can be used to center local knowledge, explicitly address trade-offs, and develop place-based interventions towards sustainability and justice. Chapter 2 utilizes a systematic literature review to ground a holistic understanding of the sustainability outcomes of the US food system. This research found trends like an overrepresentation of environmental outcomes and lower inclusion of social outcomes in articles published by natural science journals. Chapter 3 tests methods of aggregating diverse local knowledge into an accurate and parsimonious representation of a complex system using a case study of the Flint, Michigan food system. We found that aggregating by identity groups serves as a poor proxy for cognitive diversity in a system where knowledge and expertise can arise from many sources. Chapter 4 focuses on synthesizing and evaluating interventions towards racial equity in the Flint, MI food system. This research resulted in recommendations to provision resources towards Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) business owners and entrepreneurs, as well as lowering racialized barriers to affordability and availability to enable community members to participate in the localized food system. Finally, we conclude by exploring how transdisciplinary computational social science can be applied in complex adaptive systems to promote transparent and effective decision-making.",
          "Abstract This chapter introduces computational social science (CSS), which provides a data-driven, interdisciplinary framework for studying the formation, persistence, and decay of collective memory by integrating digital archives, social networks, and large-scale attention data. CSS enables researchers to quantify how collective memory evolves, shaping historical narratives and retention. A key result is the bi-exponential decay model, which shows that collective memory fades in two stages: a rapid initial drop as events lose relevance, followed by a slower decline as certain memories become culturally embedded. Collective attention serves as a measurable proxy for these shifts, enabling researchers to track public interest through Wikipedia views, scientific citations, media coverage, and other large-scale data sources. By bridging social memory theories with computational methods, CSS provides new insights into how collective attention shapes the long-term dynamics of memory in the digital age.",
          "Interpretation and Classification of Emotions is per- haps one of the most popular applications of NLP. Categorization and elucidation of emotions is contextual text mining that is related with the analysis and understanding of human emotions from textual data. In the area of tourism, the internet plays a major role in the advertisement of hotels. Travelers convey their experience in the hotel by posting reviews or comments on the internet. The Vendors can be benefited by considering and correcting user reviews on the internet to improvise and assess their hotels. With the reviews available in abundance over social media , excursionists find it difficult to understand all the reviews whether they have positive or negative suggestions. It takes Computational Social Science to rapidly identify if the review is a positive or negative review. Evolution in social platforms such as tourist blogs, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn has fueled interest in Interpretation and Classification of Emotion. This paper focuses on extracting different categories of customer's reviews about various places of stay and analyzing the category that gives better results. Multilayer Perceptron model is used for classification of data into negative and positive sentiment categories. Classifying the data into positive and negative classes with fewer mis-classifications is the primary focus.",
          "Computational social science, as with all complex adaptive systems sciences, involves a great amount of uncertainty on several fronts, including intrinsic arbitrariness such as that due to path dependence, disagreement on social theory and how to capture it in software, input data of different credibility that does not exactly match the requirements of software because it was gathered for another purpose, and inexactly matching translations between models that were designed for different purposes than the study at hand. This paper presents a method of formally tracking that uncertainty, keeping the data input parameters proportionate with logical and probabilistic constraints, and capturing proportionate dynamics of the output ordered by the decision points of policy change, for the purpose of risk-based analysis. Once ordered this way, the data can be compared to other data similarly expressed, whether that data is from simulation excursions or from the real world, for objective comparison and distance scoring at the level of dynamic patterns as opposed to single outcome validation. This method enables wargame adjudicators to be run out with data gleaned from the wargame, enables data to be repurposed for both training and testing set, and facilitates objective validation scoring through soft matching. Artificial intelligence tools used in the method include probabilistic ontologies with crisp and Bayesian inference, game trees that are multiplayer non-zero sum and decision point based rather than turn-based, and Markov processes to represent the dynamic data and align the models for objective comparison.",
          "To provide solutions to the world’s global challenges, there is an urgent demand for wise organisations, wise leadership, wise workers, and most importantly, for wise actions. Since the mid-1990s, Knowledge Management (KM) as a discipline and practice has emerged internationally, and it has passed through several phases of development. Simultaneously, in the last four decades we have experienced a growth of wisdom research and intensified discourses about Wisdom Management (WM) as a possible venue for dealing with wicked problems. The dilemma is whether the current sixth phase of KM is able to address the global problems of the world. Therefore, this conceptual paper seeks to answer the question if WM will complement or replace KM. This paper explores the evolutionary phases of KM; it presents the discourses about WM, and it discovers the presence of wisdom in the KM literature (1995–2022). The research approach is explorative and inductive. Methods of Computational Social Sciences and RStudio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are utilised for analysing, visualising, and interpreting the data. This paper analyses 255 wisdom-related keywords that emerged from 39 sources written by 50 authors. The three data analyses methods are: word cloud data analysis; dictionary-based data analysis, and bipartite network analysis. The findings are presented in word clouds; keywords frequency; bipartite network, and in a synthesised framework to show the similar and different concepts of KM and WM. The novelty value of this paper is the result of the bipartite network analysis that allows to identify how authors and wisdom-related keywords are connected with the same word nodes. This paper contributes to KM because it is the first study to explore and illustrate the presence of wisdom attributes in the KM literature.",
          "Statistical relational models such as Markov logic networks (MLNs) and hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs) are specified using templated weighted first-order logic clauses, leading to the creation of complex, yet easy to encode models that effectively combine uncertainty and logic. Learning the structure of these models from data reduces the human effort of identifying the right structures. In this work, we present an asynchronous deep reinforcement learning algorithm to automatically learn HL-MRF clause structures. Our algorithm possesses the ability to learn semantically meaningful structures that appeal to human intuition and understanding, while simultaneously being able to learn structures from data, thus learning structures that have both the desirable qualities of interpretability and good prediction performance. The asynchronous nature of our algorithm further provides the ability to learn diverse structures via exploration, while remaining scalable. We demonstrate the ability of the models to learn semantically meaningful structures that also achieve better prediction performance when compared with a greedy search algorithm, a path-based algorithm, and manually defined clauses on two computational social science applications: i) modeling recovery in alcohol use disorder, and ii) detecting bullying.",
          "The integration of social science with computer science and engineering fields has produced a new area of study: computational social science. This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: ( a) social network analysis and group formation; ( b) collective behavior and political sociology; ( c) the sociology of knowledge; ( d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; ( e) the production of culture; ( f) economic sociology and organizations; and ( g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.",
          "The development of computational social sciences has enhanced our ability to use databases of digitized culture to quantify the past. Concomitantly, new historical econometrics tools have allowed the estimation of socio-economic variables further into the past. Together, these historical cultural and socioeconomic data allow an unprecedented capacity to describe the relationship between culture, historical events and socioeconomic dynamics. Here, we focus on the analysis of texts using bags-of-word frequencies, describe potential challenges, and propose a pipeline to improve validity and generalizability. In particular, while the gold standard approach for bags-of-words – the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count – has been validated with psychometric experimentation in modern participants, it has two main limitations. First, it is limited in the number of variables that we can explore; and second, because it has been validated for modern language users it might not be valid for other historical contexts. Here we offer a complementary approach which ensures the i) historical adequacy of the search terms, ii) the measurements’ internal coherence and iii) external validation vis a vis other tools. We present the pipeline, examples and scripts which might assist junior researchers to develop custom bags-of-words and conduct their own analysis of historical texts.",

          "We have entered a new era of scholarship: the computational era. As digitized data and computational methods revolutionize the way we understand ourselves, society, and our place in society, these methods have revived questions about the role of science and objectivity in understanding society. For some, this moment has reanimated the ideal of science as disembodied objectivity, a totalizing ideology long critiqued by feminist and other critical theorists. For others, computational methods have the potential to make transparent the necessary interplay between subject and object in producing knowledge, enhancing the ideal of embodied objectivity. Starting from the premise that objectivity in knowledge creation is a worthy—even utopian—pursuit, this essay argues four things. First, applying computational methods toward the goal of disembodied objectivity profoundly misunderstands the nature of the methods and undermines the revolutionary potential of the current moment for the social sciences and humanities. Second, computational methods are instead perfectly aligned with, and can be used to enhance, the embodied vision of objectivity. Third, embodied objectivity enables us to better leverage computational tools to produce more accurate accounts of the world. Fourth, I borrow from the theory of situated knowledges and partial perspectives to provide four principles to guide this new era of scholarship.",

For this, we illustrate our argument considering the usage of social networks in the Population-Scale Network Analysis (POPNET) project through the presentation of Frank Takes at the 7th International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2). The main argument is that more attention should be given to the theoretical assumptions to motivate, refine and explore more profound relevant research questions of interest to social scientists. We comment on using small-world research to identify how different research questions can be further explored.",
          "This white paper introduces the Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE), a systems-engineering framework designed to simulate the evolution of complex civilizations. By treating narrative not as a scripted story, but as an emergent property of legal, economic, and ontological systems, the SOE framework transforms \"world-building\" into a rigorous discipline of Civilization Modeling. While the core architecture is genre-agnostic, this paper demonstrates its application through the lens of a new design-fiction school: Speculative Procedural Ontopunk (SPO). Reference ImplementationsThis framework is currently operational in two distinct genres: Sci-Fi (SPO): The Codex Totalis (The Caldwell Legacy) Fantasy (Magocracy): The Codex Octavis (The Octavian Archives) Review the SOE Framework in Notebook LM: [LINK] Abstract This paper introduces the Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE), a rigorous and extensible framework for civilization-modeling that treats narrative as an emergent, verifiable output of a complex system. We propose an alternative methodological framework for narrative construction, moving from traditional \"world-building\" to a disciplined form of civilization-modeling grounded in systems theory. While the reference implementation focuses on a school of design-fiction we term Speculative Procedural Ontopunk (SPO), the underlying architecture is genre-agnostic. The framework prioritizes the administrative, legal, and ontological protocols of a civilization as the primary drivers of conflict. The core of the SOE is a recursive causal algorithm, the Antivalent Cycle, which models historical progression as a series of codified systemic responses to emergent crises. This process is governed by the Antivalent Design Principle, grounded in theories of complex systems. We detail the MODEL Framework’s four-component architecture—the Kernel, the Variable, the Cycle, and the CORE—and utilize the THREAD Axioms to constrain the logic of the reference simulation. The result is a transparent, repeatable engine for architecting \"Societal Flight Simulators,\" reframing narrative creation as a disciplined form of speculative social modeling analogous to computational social science. The canonical instantiation of this framework is the Codex Totalis.

          "The ever-increasing frequency of sharing on social media makes these platforms one of the primary sources of data for computational social science studies. Similarly, examining and analyzing large scale social media data-sets is crucial for governments as well as companies. However, as the amount of data increases, insights that need to be derived from the data using artificial intelligence based models becomes more and more demanding in terms of processing power. In fact, hardware requirements might dramatically increase if the insights are needed under real-time or near-real time constraints. In this study, we developed a distributed sentiment analysis model that utilizes a large social media data-set. 16 million tweets have been collected and grouped by the originating city. The sentiment analysis model was produced by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model. Distributed big data analytics engine, Apache Spark, is used to execute the trained model in a distributed fashion. For evaluation purposes, the prediction time on a single compute unit is compared with the distributed prediction time. Sentiment analysis model has been executed separately for each of the data-groups corresponding to 81 provinces.

          "Abstract The chapter summarizes the key arguments of the book, outlines its contribution, and defends its premises against criticisms. Against the criticism of ignoring human agency, I hold that social theories only offer us tools for making sense of empirical observations, rather than represent the social world “as it really is.” The notion of human agency, and ontological discussions in general, helps little in this regard. Against the inclusion of nonhuman entities like objects or concepts (Fuchs) in networks, I see the focus on social networks and on communication in them as key for the connection between relational sociology and empirical studies on social networks. Three areas for future research are: (1) the relation between informal networks and formal organization; (2) network constellations in fields of society like politics, the economy, or science; and (3) the study of social networks in processes of communication in computational social science.",

          "This study analyzes Turkey's political landscape by harnessing Computational Social Science techniques to parse extensive data about public ideologies from the Politus database. Unlike existing theoretical framework that considers ideologies of political elites and cadres, this study examines public ideologies in a contentious political manner. It distills eight most prevalent ideologies down to the city level and employs unsupervised machine learning models. The Principal Component Analysis delineates two fundamental axes, the traditional left-right political spectrum and a separate spectrum of secular-religious inclination, namely political and cultural dimensions. Then, the Cluster Analysis reveals three distinct groups: left-leaning and religiously inclined, right-leaning and religiously inclined, and those with centrist views with a pronounced secular focus. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the political and cultural axes within political society, offering a clearer understanding of the most recent ideological and political climate in Turkey.",
          "The multimodal dataset focuses on climate change communication across two major social video platforms: BiliBili (China) and YouTube (United Kingdom). These platforms were selected because their long-form video formats lend themselves particularly well to narrative analysis, offering advantages over other forms of social media. The dataset comprises video cover images, metadata, engagement statistics, and textual content (titles, descriptions, and transcripts) for 2,798 videos (2,092 from BiliBili and 706 from YouTube), timeframe ranges from May 2007 to April 2025. The dataset offers substantial potential for researchers in environmental communication, digital humanities and computational social science, enabling cross-cultural analysis of public discourse and storytelling practices related to the climate crisis.",
          "The last half century has witnessed the digitization of human life, with a sharp inflection point being the widespread adoption of the Internet. In the wake of this digitization the phrase “big data” has been coined. Because many big data are explicitly or implicitly relational, this digitization of humanity has been critical in the increase in the study of networks. Further, since this digitization process continues not only forward but backward (e.g., through the scanning of millions of books and news periodicals going back for centuries), it is likely that the social sciences will be recentered over the next generation around computational approaches to data emphasizing (1) the relational aspects of human behavior, (2) phenomena that exist on societal scales rather than just individual ones, and (3) the dynamics of human behavior. This chapter discusses, in particular, the potential transformation of political science in these directions.",
          "In 1982, geodemographics was “the new magic.” The system promised to pinpoint voters. One of its key developers, Jonathan Robbin, boasted, “Tell me someone's zip code, and I can predict what they eat, drink, drive—even think.” What was the secret? Robbin and his company, the Claritas Corporation, were among the first to merge newly digitized census data and computational social science into a geodemographic system called PRIZM. It produced new categories of populations known as clusters. These clusters provided a novel and legible form of computer demographics for marketers reliant on direct mail. Drawing on interviews and historical research, this article chronicles the understudied history of the Claritas Corporation. At a time of growing distress about microtargeting and behavioral advertising, the Claritas Corporation is a critical case to understand how computing changed how marketers and politicians distinguished, described, and marketed to Americans.",
          "In the era of big and ubiquitous data, professionals and students alike are finding themselves needing to perform a number of textual analysis tasks. Historically, the general lack of statistical expertise and programming skills has stopped many with humanities or social sciences backgrounds from performing and fully benefiting from such analyses. Thus, we introduce Coconut Libtool (www.coconut-libtool.com/), an open-source, web-based application that utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Coconut Libtool analyzes text data from customized files and bibliographic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Lens. Users can verify which functions can be performed with the data they have. Coconut Libtool deploys multiple algorithmic NLP techniques at the backend, including topic modeling (LDA, Biterm, and BERTopic algorithms), network graph visualization, keyword lemmatization, and sunburst visualization. Coconut Libtool is the people-first web application designed to be used by professionals, researchers, and students in the information sciences, digital humanities, and computational social sciences domains to promote transparency, reproducibility, accessibility, reciprocity, and responsibility in research practices.",

          "The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary 2015 (LIWC2015) is a standard text analysis dictionary that quantifies the linguistic and psychometric properties of English words. A Japanese version of the LIWC2015 dictionary (J-LIWC2015) has been expected in the fields of natural language processing and cross-cultural research. This study aims to create the J-LIWC2015 through systematic investigations of the original dictionary and Japanese corpora. The entire LIWC2015 dictionary was initially subjected to human and machine translation into Japanese. After verifying the frequency of use of the words in large corpora, frequent words and phrases that are unique to Japanese were added to the dictionary, followed by recategorization by psychologists. The updated dictionary indicated good internal consistency, semantic equivalence with the original LIWC2015 dictionary, and good construct validity in each category. The evidence suggests that the J-LIWC2015 dictionary is a powerful research tool in computational social science to scrutinize the psychological processes behind Japanese texts and promote standardized cross-cultural investigations in combination with LIWC dictionaries in different languages.",
          "ABSTRACT I present new measures of generosity, coverage and institutional characteristics of work‐injury policy across 189 countries in the Global Work‐Injury Policy Dataset (GWIP) version 2.0. To date, major research efforts produced detailed social policy data for the rich Western countries, and more recently countries of Eastern, Central and Central‐Eastern Europe. One of the products of this work, the Social Insurance Entitlements Dataset (SIED) has become a benchmark for social policy research. Using hand‐coded data, indicators from the International Labor Organisation, the U.S. Social Security Administration's ‘Social Security Programs Throughout the World’, and computational social science, I demonstrate a process to successfully extend and harmonise the SIED work‐injury coverage and generosity variables to cover the Global South; in total 167 countries. I also extrapolate to 189 countries in total using imputation for the year 2020 or latest. These data will further various welfare state and social policy research agendas, in particular in the area of work‐injury policy which is often understudied in comparison to other social security policies. As a demonstration I use the GWIP data to analyse classic hypotheses in welfare state research regarding the logic of industrialization and cultural values.",

          "The Social Identity Model of Recovery (SIMOR) suggests that addiction recovery is a journey through time where membership in various groups facilitates success. With the help of computational approaches, we now have access to new resources to study whether a wide variety of different online communities can be part of the addiction recovery journey. In this work, we study the effects of two main social factors on recovery success: first, multiple group membership defined in terms of richness of online community engagement;second, active participation operationalized as the evenness in engagement with these groups. We then model recovery from addiction by applying the extended Cox regression model which accounts for the effect of these two factors on time to relapse. We applied our analysis to a dataset of 457 recovering opioid addicts that self-announced the date of their recovery, indicating that at least 219 (48%) addicts relapsed during the recovery period. We find that multiple group membership – in terms of the number of other forums that a subject had posted in - as well as active participation - in terms of how evenly their posts were spread amongst the different forums - reduced the risk of relapse. We discuss our findings with regards to the opportunity, but also risk, that online group membership poses for recovering opioid addicts, as well as the possible contribution that computational social science methods can make to the study of addiction and recovery.",

          "Successful instances of interdisciplinary collaboration can eventually enter a process of disciplinarisation. This article analyses one of those instances: agent-based computational social science, an emerging disciplinary field articulated around the use of computational models to study social phenomena. The discussion centres on how, in knowledge transfer dynamics from traditional disciplinary areas, practitioners parsed several epistemic resources to produce new foundational disciplinary shared commitments, and how disagreements operated as a mechanism of differentiation in their production. Two parsing processes are examined to illustrate this claim. The first one is the parsing of the qualitative–quantitative dualism, arguably the most important methodological disagreement in social science. The second one is the parsing of prediction, a key value in contemporary science. The analysis evidences that disagreements have fostered both external and internal dynamics of differentiation in agent-based computational social science. The former have permitted a more efficient use of epistemic resources, whereas the latter have forced practitioners to modify the foundational narrative and the agenda of the field. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",
          "Welcome to the third issue of IASSIST Quarterly for the year 2022 - IQ vol. 46(3). &#x0D; In Denmark we sometimes retrieve an old quote from a member of the Danish Parliament: 'If those are the facts, then I deny the facts'. We have laughed at that for more than a hundred years, but now fact denial is apparently the new normal in many places. And we are not amused. Data can become dangerous as facts can be fabricated. Therefore, a critical approach to data is fundamental to producing reliable information: facts. The articles in this issue are about teaching students good data behavior, and how researchers with great care and attention can carry out the task of fact production.&#x0D; The first article is about improvement in teaching data: 'Investigating teaching practices in quantitative and computational Social Sciences: a case study' by Rebecca Greer and Renata G. Curty. The authors are both at the University of California, Santa Barbara Library, where Rebecca Greer is director of Teaching &amp; Learning and Renata Curty is social science research facilitator. They are investigating data education and present some of the findings from a local report - part of a national project - into how instructors adapt curricula and pedagogy to advance undergraduates computational and statistical knowledge in the social sciences. The core goal of the instructors concerns 'data thinking' - the critical understanding and evaluation of data. Many students have a preconceived fear of mathematics that influences other areas. Personally, I feel that data thinking is essential to live and participation in society, and I believe that it should be achievable even with a background of math fear. However, for social science students I also expect they have acquired some level of 'data doing'. I agree with the authors that the necessary support for data is more often found in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics than it is in Social Sciences. However, many IASSIST members successfully work to relate data to social science students. And the implicit relationship via data to STEM areas will furthermore often improve job success for social science students. The local study interviewed instructors and the article presents among other things the learning goals and the explicit skills contained in these goals. The study uses many quotations from the interviewees, including quotes on sharing among the instructors. This leads to how the instructors can be further supported and how the library can support them, including a partnership between the library's Research Data Services and Teaching &amp; Learning.&#x0D; With the second article we continue at a university. Now the focus shifts from teaching to research - the other main area of university work, and more specifically the data in research. The article 'Research data integrity: A cornerstone of rigorous and reproducible research' is by Patricia B. Condon, Julie F. Simpson and Maria E. Emanuel. All three are in positions at the University of New Hampshire, Durham, USA. The article starts with the foundation of the four Rs of research: rigor, reproducibility, replication, and reuse. The interest in data integrity came from a question at a graduate seminar on the difference between data integrity and data quality. When exploring the data quality component, they found that research data integrity is closely associated with data management as well as with data security. The aims of the article are several, but the first is to establish practical explanations of research data integrity and its components. Training and documentation are fundamental and form the surroundings in the proposed Research Data Integrity Model that also graphically presents the overlapping areas between the components: data quality, data management, and data security. I find this focus on the sharing between components a structurally clear approach, and with good outcome too. When juggling concepts that often are regarded as being more or less identical, it is clearly positive to make these relationships and distinctions. This positive structural approach is continued as the authors relate research data integrity to the research data lifecycle to produce an implementation schema. The last section is relating research data integrity to the four Rs.&#x0D; Submissions of papers for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome. We welcome input from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and workshops, from local presentations or papers especially written for the IQ.

          "Social media house a trove of relevant information for the study of online opinion dynamics. However, harvesting and analyzing the sheer overload of data that is produced by these media poses immense challenges to journalists, researchers, activists, policy makers, and concerned citizens. To mitigate this situation, this article discusses the creation of (social) media observatories: platforms that enable users to capture the complexities of social behavior, in particular the alignment and misalignment of opinions, through computational analyses of digital media data. The article positions the concept of “observatories” for social media monitoring among ongoing methodological developments in the computational social sciences and humanities and proceeds to discuss the technological innovations and design choices behind social media observatories currently under development for the study of opinions related to cultural and societal issues in European spaces. Notable attention is devoted to the construction of Penelope: an open, web-services-based infrastructure that allows different user groups to consult and contribute digital tools and observatories that suit their analytical needs. The potential and the limitations of this approach are discussed on the basis of a climate change opinion observatory that implements text analysis tools to study opinion dynamics concerning themes such as global warming. Throughout, the article explicitly acknowledges and addresses potential risks of the machine-guided and human-incentivized study of opinion dynamics. Concluding remarks are devoted to a synthesis of the ethical and epistemological implications of the exercise of positioning observatories in contemporary information spaces and to an examination of future pathways for the development of social media observatories.",

          "Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph-and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.",

          "This chapter explains content analysis, which is a social science research method that involves the systematic analysis of text, media, communication, or information. The source, the message, the receiver, the medium, and the influence of the message are all topics that have been studied using content analysis and in combination with other methods. There are deductive and inductive approaches to content analysis. Two widely cited studies using content analysis take a deductive approach: using predefined categories and variables based on findings and best practices from prior research. Studies taking an inductive approach to content analysis, by contrast, have an open view of the content, usually involve a small-N sample, and are often based on a qualitative approach. Meanwhile, much has been written on methods and approaches to measuring reliability with human coders. Traditional content analysis uses human coders, whereas a variety of software has emerged that can be used to download and score or code vast amounts of textual news data. The chapter then identifies key benefits and challenges associated with new computational social science tools such as text analysis.",
          "Using techniques from the experimental and computational social sciences, this dissertation identifies three central flaws in one of our most important mechanism designs – elections – and identifies institutional methods to solve these problems. Mechanism design is the “engineering” side of economic theory. Where game theory “takes the rules of the game as given, and [] makes predictions about the behavior of strategic players,” mechanism design “is about the optimal choice of the rules of the game.” For mechanism designers, identifying the optimal choice of rules typically depends on predicting how individuals will behave in certain environments. Both mechanism design and game theory, therefore, rely on identifying equilibriums – that is, joint strategic solutions where no one involved has an incentive to deviate from the strategy that they are playing. Economists argue that electoral accountability can be seen a special version of mechanism design. The logic is this. Electoral institutions establish processes for selecting candidates for public office, in such a way as to incentivize them to act in the public interest. To achieve this result, electoral institutions lead to a cascade of mutually-reinforcing incentives. These institutions (a) incentivize voters to retrospectively evaluate officials' performances such that (b) victorious candidates will tend to act in the public interest. Therefore, electoral accountability is a set of institutions, and the incentives that predictably flow from it. The promise of mechanism designers is that, if the institutions are created correctly, officials will be accountable to the public. And this accountability will occur as a matter of course: mechanically.In fact, however, this mechanism is broken. This dissertation solves its problems. Chapters 2 and 3 represent three efforts at testing rational choice-based theories of electoral accountability through randomized control trials. These studies take aim at concepts that are crucial to our understanding of a central feature driving retrospective evaluation of policy. Chapter 4 operates at a more theoretical level, but nonetheless retains its behavioral approach. It offers an approach to legal chance that highlights the strategic alternatives facing firms. Chapter 5 offers institutional fixes to the problems identified in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.",
          "In recent years, a variety of novel digital data sources, colloquially referred to as “big data,” have taken the popular imagination by storm. These data sources include but are not limited to: digitized administrative records; activity on and contents of social media and internet platforms; and readings from sensors that track physical and environmental conditions. Some have argued that such data sets have the potential to transform our understanding of human behavior and society, constituting a meta-field known as computational social science. Such work has also required methodological advances that make the content of the data accessible and interpretable. How these promises and challenges manifest is specific to the questions and themes of a given discipline, and this bibliography summarizes how big data have been leveraged to further multiple lines of inquiry in the study of communities and crime.",
          "Abstract This paper explores the dynamic interdependencies across processes of technological innovation and production organization, education and skills formation, and economic performance. Its core argument is that economically and socially sustainable growth will depend on the evolution of the knowledge economy and the absorption and application of technological innovations, and a parallel transformation of the work force in order to supply the skills needed to implement and operate the new technology and business models. Technological innovation can lead to disruptions in the organization of production systems with high degrees of polarization, inequality and exclusion. A technology-related wage premium for education can channel benefits to those at the upper end of the educational distribution, while technological obsolescence may depress wages and employment at the lower end (exacerbated by the effects of globalization and the outsourcing and offshoring of lower-end jobs). The preparation of he work forec for the 21st century has thus become a key priority across the industrialized high-income countries. The paper is structured around three main sections. The first section explores changes in the production matrix of the global economy with reference to the evolving interdependencies of two vectors: the technological intensification of the production process (through the deepening of the penetration of ICT use and the process of automation), and globalization (through the decomposition and re-composition of production through a process of spatial re-localization and the formation of global value chains). These processes have several important consequences for the reorganization of production on a global scale. The paper explores the following: the increasing integration of products and services (‘bundling’); the formation of ‘value domains’ that might or might not coincide with spatial or geographical concentrations of economic activity; the increasing importance of global value chains; and production and innovation ecosystems. In this latter context, the paper focuses on the process of financialization and draws a distinction between ‘symbiotic’ and ‘parasitic’ ecosystems. The second section explores associated changes in the social structures of production, skills and employment that present historic options for firms, states and educational institutions. More specifically, the paper explores: the role of the state in the organization of production and technological development; the policy quandaries regarding production, skills development and sustainability; the differentiated effects on, and degrees of vulnerability of, different occupations and skills replacement through commoditization and automation; at regional level this is encountered in efforts toward ‘smart specialization’; the re-composition of skills, These trends are reflected in changes in the structures of social classes with two fundamental characteristics: polarization and inequality and the growing ascendance of the ‘creative class’. The third section explores the implications of the above changes for education and research systems. These manifest themselves along two key dimensions: the content of research education and their organization. In this section the paper concentrates on the following aspects: the current state of educational systems and their coordination with changes in technology and production systems; emerging educational requirements; leading practices, and lack thereof, of coordination between employers and skills providers, tendencies toward ‘education ecosystems’; and new scientific approaches and directions in the area of analysis of social systems: social physics and computational social sciences, and their potential implications for aligning dynamics of innovation, education and skills development, and occupational profiles. The paper concludes by reflecting on the broader context of institutional change and coherence required for the transition to a sustainable Knowledge Economy geared to prosperity, equitability and social inclusion and the competitiveness of nations.",
          "This study analyzes Turkey's political landscape by harnessing Computational Social Science techniques to parse extensive data about public ideologies from the Politus database. Unlike existing theoretical frameworks that focus on the ideologies of political elites and cadres, this study examines public ideologies in a contentious political manner. Exploiting an AI-based data generation pipeline on digital traces, it distills the eight most prevalent ideologies down to the province level and employs exploratory statistical analyses. Principal Component Analysis delineates two fundamental axes: the traditional left-right political spectrum and a separate spectrum of secular-religious inclination, encompassing both political and cultural dimensions. Then, the Cluster Analysis reveals three distinct groups: left-leaning and religiously inclined, center-right-leaning and religiously inclined, and those with a center-right-leaning focus and a pronounced secular orientation. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the political and cultural axes within political society, offering a clearer understanding of the most recent ideological and political climate in Turkey.",
          "Since the deep learning revolution, a general trend in machine learning literature has been that large, deep models will consistently outperform small, shallow models. This trend, however, comes with the drawback of ever-increasing compute requirements, with many recent state-of-the-art results requiring resources well out of reach of all but the top industry labs. Such issues raise very real concerns with regards to the democratisation of machine learning research, and left unaddressed could ultimately lead to more power and wealth being concentrated in the institutions which are able to invest extremely large sums of money into their AI research programs today. Transfer learning techniques are a potential solution to these issues, allowing large, general models to be trained once, and then reused in a variety of situations with minimal computation required to adapt them. This work explores novel algorithms and applications of transfer learning in domains as diverse as hierarchical reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and computational social science. Within the hierarchical reinforcement learning domain, we present an algorithm that allows for transfer between options (i.e., temporally abstracted actions) over separate but similar tasks. In the generative modeling domain, we present an algorithm for reusing existing invertible generative models on new data without incurring any extra training cost. Lastly, in the computational social science domain, we show that knowledge can be transferred from human-designed models in order to detect malicious activity targeting a ranking algorithm. The common thread between all of the algorithms presented in this thesis is that they are inherently Bayesian. We argue that the Bayesian paradigm naturally lends itself to transfer learning applications, in that Bayesian priors can serve as adaptable, general models which can be transformed into task-specific posteriors through the process of inference.",
          "In this talk, I explain why I believe that computational social science and (online) open data can expose, reproduce, and transpose (offline) infrastructural inequalities related to disability. To make this point, I draw on the first phase of a multi-stage, mixed methods research project that centres around a “public washrooms” dataset released by the City of Vancouver. I discuss how, in this case, open data can: be used to expose gaps in infrastructural services for wheelchair users; reproduce disableism by providing misleading or inaccurate data, and; transpose disableism from (offline) infrastructural and resource deficits into (online) informational deficits, which then also influence (offline) engagement with urban environments.",
          "Generative agent simulations offer transformative potential for computational social science (CSS); however, the requirement for sophisticated programming expertise limits their adoption to technical specialists, excluding many domain experts. This paper presents a web-based, open-source platform that democratizes access to the Concordia framework through an intuitive, no-code interface. The system allows researchers to configure, execute, and analyze multi-agent simulations without writing code, bridging the gap between domain expertise and technical implementation. Key technical contributions include a robust reliability layer designed to sustain long-running simulations, incorporating automatic checkpointing and timeout protection to mitigate the external LLM API instability inherent in extended execution times. Additionally, the system features a provider-agnostic adapter supporting both major commercial model APIs and locally hosted models. The platform further streamlines research workflows through configurable game master templates (generic, game-theoretic, questionnaire-based) and automated LLM-powered analysis tools. We evaluate the system across diverse scenarios and discuss the trade-offs between this web interface and the native Concordia Python framework. By eliminating programming barriers while preserving advanced simulation capabilities, this tool serves as both an accessible entry point for non-technical researchers and a rapid prototyping environment for experts.",
          "The thesis is a collection of six stand-alone chapters aimed at setting the foundations for the philosophy of computational social science. Agent-based modelling has been used for social research since the nineties. While at the beginning it was simply conceived as a methodological alternative, recently, the notion of ‘computational social science’ has started to be used to denote a separate disciplinary field. There are important differences with mainstream social science and traditional social research. Yet, the literature in the field has not accounted for these differences. Computational social science is a strongly practice-oriented field, where theoretical and philosophical concerns have been pushed into the background. This thesis presents an initial analysis of the methodology, epistemology and ontology of computational social science, by examining the following topics: 1) verification and validation and 2) modelling and theorising, 3) mechanisms 4) explanation 5) agency, action and interaction and 6) entities and process philosophy.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nFive general conclusions are drawn from the thesis. It is first argued that the wider ontological base in agent-based modelling allows for a new approach to traditional social dualisms, moving away from the methodological individualism that dominates computational social science. Second, the need to place a distinction between explanation and understanding and to make explanatory goals explicit is highlighted. Third, it is claimed that computational social science needs to pay attention to the social epistemology of the field, for this could provide important insights regarding values, ideologies and interests that underlie the practice of agent-based modelling. Fourth, it is suggested that a more robust theorisation regarding the experimental and model-based character of agent-based modelling should be developed. Finally, it is argued that the method can greatly contribute to the development of a processual account of social life.",
          "Louis Armstrong (is said to have) said, \"I don't need words -it's all in the phrasing\".As someone who does natural-language processing for a living, I'm a big fan of words; but lately, my collaborators and I have been studying aspects of phrasing (in the linguistic, rather than musical sense) that go beyond just the selection of one particular word over another.I'll describe some of these projects in this talk.The issues we'll consider include: Does the way in which something is worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it is remembered or attracts attention, beyond its content or context?Can we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their arguments, in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g., \"pro-choice\" vs. \"pro-life\")?The settings we'll explore range from movie quotes that achieve cultural prominence; to posts on Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, and the arXiv; to framing in public discourse on the inclusion of geneticallymodified organisms in food.",
          "Human behaviour plays a central role in the development and spread of epidemics, but also the opinions and attitudes that give rise to them. Hence, it is necessary to understand the social dynamics that are susceptible to contribute in the formation and spreading of opinions that are susceptible to affect collective decision making processes and behavioural changes. Specifically, individuals’ decision making processes related with vaccination have a significant impact on the control of infectious diseases. In fact, the prevention of disease contagion requires the vaccination coverage of a certain population to be above the level of herd immunity threshold. Therefore public health is closely related to these behavioural dynamics. This study aims to analyse the process of minority opinion spreading regarding vaccination through the computational analysis of different simulated scenarios designed with agent-based modelling, and giving response to three basic questions: (1) how the structure of social networks can affect the spread of minority opinion towards vaccination; (2) how committed or loyal agents can influence in this process (i.e. agents predisposition towards certain alternative: taking the vaccinate or not); and (3) how mass media action, as a contextual (or external) factor, might vary agents’ opinions and network composition. This study seeks to develop new and innovative models, based on computational social sciences, that contribute to the explanation and understanding of the collective dynamics of minority opinion contagion, and also to explain their potential impact on health and social behaviour under four basic simulated scenarios: (1) random individual contagion; (2) learning-based contagion; (3) preferential attachment; (4) preferential attachment and selective exposure (dual climate of opinion).",
          "Social network analysis has proliferated rapidly across the social and behavioral sciences, with increasingly apparent implications for human health. Shifting our focus from individuals to the patterns of social ties that connect them has enriched our understanding of a great variety of health-related phenomena, including the spread of STDs on contact networks, the spread of health care practices on practitioners’ professional networks, the dynamics of patient transfers on networks of clinics, and the spread of health behaviors on adolescent friendship networks. The advent of computational social science has augmented such contributions by introducing scalable methods of automatically monitoring and rigorously modeling these phenomena. Sample applications include analysis of electronic health records and other time-stamped communication traces among health care practitioners; streams of behavioral and biometric data from wearable sensors, location-aware devices, or electronic calendars; automated analysis of text in documents using natural language processing; and mapping networks of scientific collaboration by citations and co-authorships in clinical research literatures. Whereas much work in computational social science has offered new ways of empirically monitoring health behavior and health care behavior, a further contribution has been to directly model these social processes using system dynamics, microsimulation, discrete event simulation, and agent-based models. These approaches allow for computational ‘virtual’ experiments that assist in predicting, interpreting, and evaluating outcomes from health interventions. This poster will highlight some of my recent and pending work in this broad domain, aiming to identify potential collaborators in UMCCTS for projects that involve social networks or computational social science.",

Statistics such as the number of followers, number of tweets, types of hashtags (#) used, and when tweets are shared during the day are also provided to illustrate how programs use Twitter. A composite score was also developed to highlight the top 10 social work programs on Twitter. Implications for social work education are given along with suggestions for programs in developing a social media strategy.",
          "How does an issue become a political problem? No issue inherently requires political responses. Instead, political actors construct arguments regarding the nature of a given problem and connect them to particular policy actions. For example, some see digital technology as a threat to democracy and advocate for stricter regulation, while others emphasize its potential to improve participation and argue that tighter rules stifle innovation. This phenomenon, known as \"problem definition,\" has long been recognized as a fundamental aspect of any policymaking process. Theoretically, PRODIGI argues that the notion of problem definition needs to integrate the dynamics induced by digital technology, such as new forms of political communication that bypass traditional gatekeepers. The state of the art does not adequately describe these new dynamics. On the one hand, the literature on digital technology and politics has not explicitly recognized problem definition as a key aspect. On the other hand, the agenda setting and problem definition literatures have not integrated the role of digital technology in their arguments. Specifically, PRODIGI pursues four objectives: 1) develop a theory of problem definition that accounts for the role of digital technology; 2) develop new methods to measure problem definition based on computational social science; 3) analyze problem definition in the case of policy responses to digital technology's implications for democracy; and 4) analyze the effects of problem definition on opinions using survey experiments. PRODIGI breaks new ground in two ways. First, it puts forward original theory and methods to study a longstanding question that has acquired new relevance in digital environments. Second, it applies the new theory and methods to an important societal challenge, namely, how politics responds to digital technology's impact on democracy.",

          "The challenge of disentangling political communication processes and their effects has grown with the complexity of the new political information environment. But so have scientists' toolsets and capacities to better study and understand them. We map the challenges and opportunities of developing, synthesizing, and applying data collection and analysis techniques relying primarily on computational methods and tools to answer substantive theory-driven questions in the field of political communication. We foreground the theoretical, empirical, and institutional opportunities and challenges of Computational Communication Science (CCS) that are relevant to the political communication community. We also assess understandings of CCS and highlight challenges associated with data and resource requirements, as well as those connected with the theory and semantics of digital signals. With an eye to existing practices, we elaborate on the key role of infrastructures, academic institutions, ethics, and training in computational methods. Finally, we present the six full articles and two forum contributions of this special issue illustrating methodological innovation, as well as the theoretical, practical, and institutional relevance and challenges for realizing the potential of computational methods in political communication.",
          "Abstract Longitudinal clustering techniques are widely deployed in computational social science to delineate groupings of subjects characterized by meaningful developmental trends. In criminology, such methods have been utilized to examine the extent to which micro places (such as streets) experience macro-level police-recorded crime trends in unison. This has largely been driven by a theoretical interest in the longitudinal stability of crime concentrations, a topic that has become particularly pertinent amidst a widespread decline in recorded crime. Recent studies have tended to rely on a generic implementation k-means to unpick this stability, with little consideration for its theoretical suitability. This study makes two methodological contributions. First, it demonstrates the application of k-medoids to study longitudinal crime concentrations, and second, it develops a novel ‘anchored k-medoids’ (ak-medoids), a bespoke clustering method specifically designed to meet the theoretical requirements of micro-place investigations into long-term stability. Using both simulated data and 15-years of police-recorded crime data from Birmingham, England, we compare the performances of k-medoids against ak-medoids. We find that both methods highlight instability in the exposure to crime over time, but the consistency and contribution of cluster solutions determined by ak-medoids provide insight overlooked by k-medoids, which is sensitive to short-term fluctuations and subject starting points. This has important implications for the theories said to explain longitudinal crime concentrations, and the law enforcement agencies seeking to offer an effective and equitable service to the public.",
          "This study tries to understand the impact of social media algorithms on teenagers’ brain and emotions through a cross-field approach that integrates concepts from cognitive neuroscience, behavioral psychology, and computational social science. Set in five government senior secondary schools of Shahdara district, Delhi, the research employed a mixed-methods design to capture both the measurable and lived dimensions of algorithmic curation. Quantitatively, data were collected from 46 Class 12 students (28 male, 18 female) using standardized tools to assess affect, distress, sleep quality, and loneliness, alongside a study-specific Algorithmic Exposure Index (AEI) reflecting the intensity of personalized recommendations, autoplay features, and time spent on algorithm-driven feeds. Qualitatively, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 students (6 male, 5 female) to probe perceived changes in attention, mood volatility, reward sensitivity (likes/shares), body image, social comparison, and sleep hygiene. Reliability analyses demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α range: .84–.90 across scales; AEI α = .86). Pearson correlations showed significant positive associations between AEI and negative affect (r = .42, p = .004), psychological distress (K10; r = .48, p = .001), loneliness (UCLA-3; r = .35, p = .016), and sleep problems (r = .31, p = .032), with a marginal negative association with positive affect (r = −.28, p = .064). A multiple regression model (R² = .36) indicated AEI as a unique predictor of negative affect (β = .39, p = .003) after controlling for gender and total daily screen time. Thematic analysis (six themes) illuminated mechanisms of “personalization pull,” “endless-scroll trance,” and “mood rollercoaster,” among others, consistent with dopaminergic reward loops and social comparison processes. Findings suggest that algorithmically intensified feeds are linked with heightened distress and mood dysregulation in late adolescents, implying a need for school-level digital hygiene programs, transparent recommender policies, and parental co-regulation strategies. The study concludes that a cross-field lens offers a more complete map of how algorithmic design meets developing adolescent neuro-emotional systems, and it outlines actionable pathways for educators and policymakers in urban Indian contexts.",
          "This paper investigates the influence of the research produced by a vocal minority of researchers in a body of 48 articles regarding the differential effect of structural factors on racially disaggregated crime rates in the US. The computational social science analysis underlines the limited influence of methodological choices on the scientists’ conclusions. However, it is shown how a particularly productive research team has distorted the state of the art by systematically concluding that the racial invariance thesis is refuted, even though their raw quantitative findings differ from one study to another. In the absence of constraining scientific standards, this vocal minority is free to adopt interpretations that are consistent with its prior theoretical interests.",
          "This book presents a multi-disciplinary investigation into extortion rackets with a particular focus on the structures of criminal organisations and their collapse, societal processes in which extortion rackets strive and fail and the impacts of bottom-up and top-down ways of fighting extortion racketeering. Through integrating a range of disciplines and methods the book provides an extensive case study of empirically based computational social science. It is based on a wealth of qualitative data regarding multiple extortion rackets, such as the Sicilian Mafia, an international money laundering organisation and a predatory extortion case in Germany. Computational methods are used for data analysis, to help in operationalising data for use in agent-based models and to explore structures and dynamics of extortion racketeering through simulations. In addition to textual data sources, stakeholders and experts are extensively involved, providing narratives for analysis and qualitative validation of models. The book presents a systematic application of computational social science methods to the substantive area of extortion racketeering. The reader will gain a deep understanding of extortion rackets, in particular their entrenchment in society and processes supporting and undermining extortion rackets. Also covered are computational social science methods, in particular computationally assisted text analysis and agent-based modelling, and the integration of empirical, theoretical and computational social science.",
          "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assist computational social science research. While prior efforts have focused on text, the potential of leveraging multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for online video studies remains underexplored. We conduct one of the first case studies on MLLM-assisted video content analysis, comparing AI's interpretations to human understanding of abstract concepts. We leverage LLaVA-1.6 Mistral 7B to interpret four abstract concepts regarding video-mediated self-disclosure, analyzing 725 keyframes from 142 depression-related YouTube short videos. We perform a qualitative analysis of MLLM's self-generated explanations and found that the degree of operationalization can influence MLLM's interpretations. Interestingly, greater detail does not necessarily increase human-AI alignment. We also identify other factors affecting AI alignment with human understanding, such as concept complexity and versatility of video genres. Our exploratory study highlights the need to customize prompts for specific concepts and calls for researchers to incorporate more human-centered evaluations when working with AI systems in a multimodal context.",
          "Purpose This study aims to examine ChatGPT-4’s potential and stability when simulating school-counseling dialogues, offering an exploratory snapshot of its ability to convey warmth, empathy and acceptance. Drawing on 80 real student questions, this paper aims to assess response consistency and identify risk markers, such as randomness and hallucination. The goal of this study is to inform future research, guide human–AI (artificial intelligence) collaboration and support policy development on deploying large language model chatbots for accessible mental health interventions. Design/methodology/approach This paper prompted ChatGPT-4 with 80 authentic college student counseling questions and collected three nondeterministic replies per query. Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length. Findings ChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations. Research limitations/implications As an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings. Practical implications High warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design. Social implications Deployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling. Originality/value This paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",

          "The proliferation of online social platforms has transformed the nature of digital communities, making them central to modern discourse, information flow and knowledge mobilization. Platforms such as Twitter (now X) and Telegram provide fertile environments for the formation of dynamic, interest-based user communities. Yet, fundamental questions remain regarding how these communities emerge, what topics their members engage with, and how they evolve over time, particularly across platforms with distinct architectures and interaction models. This thesis investigates the formation, thematic engagement, and evolution of digital communities on Twitter and Telegram, two structurally distinct platforms central to modern online discourse. Using a unified analytical pipeline, monthly interaction networks were constructed and weighted by two affinity metrics, Interaction Frequency (IF) and Weighted Interaction Frequency (WIF) to detect and compare communities. A hybrid semantic approach combining LDA and GPT-4 was used to extract and interpret discussion themes, while community evolution was analyzed through member overlap and thematic similarity over time. The results show that IF and WIF produce broadly comparable communities in terms of size, centrality, and message activity. Telegram communities, active over a longer period, exhibit greater structural persistence and thematic diversity, often revolving around personal or emotional topics. In contrast, Twitter communities, though temporally shorter in duration, show high thematic consistency focused on current events and formal topics, shaped by the platform’s open broadcast model. Member mobility patterns further reveal Telegram’s stable cores and gradual growth, while Twitter communities are more transient and topic-driven. In general, the study offers a longitudinal cross-platform framework for analyzing online communities, highlighting how platform design and affinity metrics shape community life cycles and discourse dynamics, thus addressing key questions in computational social science.",
          "Facebook announced a community review program in December 2019 and Twitter launched a communitybased platform to address misinformation, called Birdwatch, in January 2021. We provide an overview of the potential affordances of such community based approaches to content moderation based on past research. While our analysis generally supports a community-based approach to content moderation, it also warns against potential pitfalls, particularly when the implementation of the new infrastructures does not promote diversity. We call for more multidisciplinary research utilizing methods from complex systems studies, behavioural sociology, and computational social science to advance the research on crowd-based content moderation.",
          "Problem: Science is full of punctuating events that terminate periods during which styles of doing research are more or less reproduced. During the Constructivist Turn (about 1976), the sociology of science left the institutionalist program behind and turned towards the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge with its focus on context effects. Social Network Analysis is a way of studying agents embedded in contexts. During the Cultural Turn (about 1992), a fraction of this domain initiated Relational Sociology, strongly associated with the theory of Harrison C. White. Proponents advocate modeling social networks not purely structurally but as intertwined with cultural meaning. Then, in about 1998, physicists discovered social networks as representations of complex systems. Small-world and scale-free networks are the paradigmatic models of this Network Science, the emergence of which marks the Complexity Turn in Social Network Analysis. This work addresses the structure/culture, micro/macro, and stability/change problems. How useful is Relational Sociology's concept of identity to model scientific communities? What is the importance of emergence in modeling identity? What mechanism can explain stability as well as change? What is the contribution of Network Science modeling? Approach: Relying on various models and mechanisms of socio-cultural processes from Relational Sociology and Complexity Science, an identity model is developed and calibrated in a case study of Social Network Science. This research domain results from the union of Social Network Analysis and Network Science. A unique dataset of 25,760 scholarly articles from one century of research (1916-2012) is created. Clustering this set of publications, five subdomains are detected that are labeled Social Psychology, Economic Sociology, Social Network Analysis, Complexity Science, and Web Science. These identities are then analyzed in terms of authorship, citation, and word usage structures and dynamics. For this purpose, a graph theoretical data model is developed that allows comparisons across these three scholarly practices. In this model, authors, cited references, and words are treated as Durkheimian social facts. The scaling hypothesis of percolation theory is formulated for socio-cultural systems, namely that power-law size distributions like Lotka's, Bradford's, and Zipf's Law mean that the described identity resides at the phase transition between the stability and change of meaning. In this case, it can be diagnosed using bivariate scaling laws and Abbott's heuristic of fractal distinctions. Results: Identities are not dichotomies but dualities of social network and cultural domain, micro and macro phenomena, as well as stability and change. First, story sets that give direction to research fluctuate less, are less distinctive, and more inert than the individuals doing the research. Words have longer average lifetimes than authors, and word co-usage meaning structures are more centralized than co-authorship networks. Second, identities are scale-free. Not only are persons, groups, organizations, etc. manifestations of an idealized identity at different levels of socio-cultural complexity. Concrete identities also extend over multiple such levels. Third, six senses are diagnostic of different aspects of identity, and when they come together as process, a complex socio-cultural system comes into existence. The scaling hypothesis needs not be rejected. The convergence of identities to linear preferential attachment indicates that stability and change co-exist at a fractal phase transition. As expected from percolation theory, this state can be described by a number of scaling laws. Self-organization to criticality is expressed through hierarchically modular small-world social structures and self-similar meaning structures and dynamics. The evolution of the domain is convergent, i.e., it does not progress in a division of labor but in distinctions that repeat in themselves. Social Psychology is an exception because its story set is too different. All other subdomains continuously change through mating with other styles. The Complexity Turn of 1998 was not a scientific revolution because Social Network Science was not normal science until 2002. It was a scientific breakthrough that caused all subdomains but Social Psychology to markedly innovate. Contribution: A scale-free identity model with a corresponding data model is built that allows for studying the structure and dynamics of complex socio-cultural systems. The model is calibrated by operationalizing concepts from the toolbox of Relational Sociology (identity, control, autocatalysis, discipline, institution, style, switching, Bayesian fork, innovation, invention, ambage, and ambiguity) and studying the identity Social Network Science using a new data set. A mutual benefit that results from mating Relational Sociology and Network Science is identified. The latter can learn from the former that social systems are dualities of transactions and meaning and that studying multiple dimensions of the same system creates valuable insights about their identity. For the social sciences, the importance of Paretian thinking (scale invariance) is pointed out. The meaning of small-world and scale-free network models is that a mechanism of fractal optimization keeps identities adaptable through balancing stability and change. First steps are taken towards predicting change through a calculus of social and cultural uncertainty, to be developed in a framework of Computational Social Science.",
          "The data-driven study of cultural information diffusion in online (social) media is currently an active area of research. The availability of data from the web thereby generates new opportunities to examine how words propagate through online media and communities, as well as how these diffusion patterns are intertwined with the materiality and culture of social media platforms. In support of such efforts, this paper introduces an online tool for tracking the consecutive occurrences of words across subreddits on Reddit between 2005 and 2017. By processing the full Pushshift.io Reddit comment archive for this period (Baumgartner et al., 2020), we are able to track the first occurrences of 76 million words, allowing us to visualize which subreddits subsequently adopt any of those words over time. We illustrate this approach by addressing the spread of terms referring to famous internet controversies, and the percolation of alt-right terminology. By making our instrument and the processed data publically available, we aim to facilitate a range of exploratory analyses in computational social science, the digital humanities, and related fields.",
          "Facebook and Twitter recently announced community-based review platforms to address misinformation.In this talk, I provide an overview of the potential affordances of such communitybased approaches to content moderation based on past research and preliminary analysis of Twitter's Birdwatch data.While our analysis generally supports a community-based approach to content moderation, it also warns against potential pitfalls, particularly when the implementation of the new infrastructure focuses on crowd-based \"validation\" rather than \"collaboration.\"We call for multidisciplinary research utilizing methods from complex systems studies, behavioural sociology, and computational social science to advance the research on crowd-based content moderation.",
          "Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) maintain archival databases of all player actions and attributes including activity by accounts engaged in illicit behavior. If individuals in online worlds operate under similar social and psychological motivations and constraints as the offline world, online behavioral data could inform theories about offline behavior. We examine high risk trading relationships in a MMOG to illuminate the structures online clandestine organizations employ to balance security with efficiency and compare this to an offline drug trafficking network. This data offers the possibility of performing social research on a scale that would be unethical or impracticable to do in the offline world. However, analyzing and generalizing from clandestine behavior in online settings raises complex epistemological and methodological questions about the validity of such mappings and what methods and metrics are appropriate in these contexts. We conclude by discussing how computational social science can be applied to online and offline criminological concerns and highlight the \"dual use\" implications of these technologies.",

          "For decades, scholars of various disciplines have been fretted over strategic interactions, presenting theoretical insights and empirical observations. Despite the central role played by strategic interactions in creating values in the Internet environment, our ability to understand them scientifically and to manage them in practice has remained limited. While engineering communities suffer from not having enough theoretical resource to formalize such phenomena, economics and social sciences lack adequate technology to properly operationalize their theoretical insights, thereby demanding an integrative solution. This project aims to develop a rational-choice-theory-driven framework for computational social science, focusing on social interactions on the Internet. In order to suggest theoretical foundations, validation of the predictions in a controlled environment, and verification of the results in actual platforms, general approaches and a few examples of ongoing research are presented.",
          "The vast amount of data produced everyday (so-called 'digital traces') and available nowadays represent a gold mine for the social sciences, especially in a computational context, that allows to fully extract their informational and knowledge value. In the latest years, statistical offices have made efforts to profit from harnessing the potential offered by these new sources of data, with promising results. But how difficult is this integration process? What are the challenges that statistical offices would likely face to profit from new data sources and analytical methods? This chapter will start by setting the scene of the current official statistics system, with a focus on its fundamental principles and dimensions relevant to the use of non-traditional data. It will then present some experiments and proofs of concept in the context of data innovation for official statistics, followed by a discussion on prospective challenges related to sustainable data access, new technical and methodological approaches and effective use of new sources of data.",
          "Abstract Computer simulations are increasingly used within various fields of the social sciences, including analytical sociology and computational social science. However, the method has yet to fully find its place within critical realism, generally regarded as reductionist and methodological individualist and thus inadequate to the task of grasping the full and enigmatic complexity of social life. This article contributes to the discussion by suggesting an alternative approach to computer simulations in the social realm. Instead of representing reality, simulations are seen as a way of boosting abstraction by enabling us to isolate and study the effects of emergent mechanisms. The need for such tools is growing more urgent in an age characterized by rapid change and global networks of causal interrelation. Hence there is a need not only for new tools to deal with causal complexity within critical realism, but also for a critical realist perspective to fill the meta‐theoretical vacuum on which the simulation approach is largely based. The approach developed here provides a challenge to the predominant ways in which simulations are utilized today, with increasingly sophisticated models aiming towards realistic representation on the basis of empirical data.",
          "As social behavior moves increasingly online, the study of social behavior has followed. Online traces of social systems, whether to study online behavior directly or the online traces of offline activity, have made possible previously unavailable empirical analyses of people, groups and organizations. However, practically observing any social system is nontrivial: even if we can directly instrument and measure the social constructs we wish to study, we will still observe this through the lens of the system itself. We inherit effects due to the design and history of the platform, the ecology of other online systems, the measurement tool and pre-processing of our data, and the assumptions of our models. At the same time, organizations represent a fundamental unit of human social behavior. Then, to understand social behavior, we must understand how the size, boundaries, and context of organizations impact social relationships within them. I focus on this boundary of online systems and offline activity in organizations. We exploit heterogeneities across populations of social networks to explore the boundary of online systems, online social behavior, and offline activity across different organizations. I discuss empirical work exploring how offline behavior is reflected in online systems, and conversely, how an online system relates to offline outcomes. We then turn to the relationship between the measurement of networks from online data and past work on network structure and evolution.\\nIn this dissertation, I develop a comparative structural perspective to tease apart the roles of these exogenous and endogenous processes on network structure. Using populations of comparable networks, I explore the roles of individual social strategies, organizational environments, and network construction on network structure. First, I explore how the unique timing and setting of Facebook's initial expansion to universities afforded a natural experiment, revealing differences in social strategies and network growth, and we explore empirical network scaling in this population of networks. We find that the social strategies employed by students who only interacted online differed from those who had interacted in the offline world. Second, I explore a vaunted tradition of organization theory---relating a firm's informal network structure to firm performance---using a novel email network data set across a population of large firms. In this setting, I explore the previously untested heterogeneity of firms and the relationships between organization size, organization context and social network structure. There, we find a surprising amount of heterogeneity across firm types, and a lack of relationship between network structure and firm performance. We find novel scaling results, including a lack of relationship between the size of a firm and an individual's number of contacts, but find that the formal geographic structure of an organization increases bottlenecks in communication across firms. Finally, reflecting on the challenges of working with social networks drawn from interaction data, I explore the connections between network construction and network evolution. To put these connections in perspective, I visit the theory of weak ties, network stability and network densification using this lens. We find evidence to confirm, reject, and suggest novel hypotheses in this literature. We find, for example, that network densification can appear as an artifact of total activity within the observed system.\\nThe comparative approach is uncontroversial but novel in the empirical study of networks, organization theory, and computational social science. In this context, the comparative approach allows us to compare empirical scaling properties to results from random graph theory. Using networks bounded by organizations and platforms, we can leverage the boundaries of online systems to relate covariates at the platform-, organization-, or network-l",
          "Many modern computational social science academics are concerned about the recent trend of information sharing. Platforms for online social networks are being exploited to spread propaganda. These days, this is a lethal tool used to undermine democracies and other religious or political gatherings. Virtually every region of the planet was impacted by the political campaign. During the height of the 2024 Indian General Assembly election, A large volume of tweets has been shared that advocate various kinds of propaganda. The research proposes a cutting-edge strategy based on artificial neural networks that categorizes tweets into Propagandistic and Non-Propagandistic categories. Data is severed out with multiple ambiguous hashtags, and after the extraction, the approach is manually annotated into binary classes. Hybrid feature engineering has been used to merge the features of \"Term Frequency (TF)/Inverse- Document Frequency (IDF), Tweet Length, and \"Bag of Words,\". The planned approach is compared with logistic regression, SVMs, and multinomial naïve Bayes. The results showed that the Artificial-Neural-Network performed with a recall of 77% along with an accuracy of 77.15% and a precision of 79% in comparison with a number of other machine learning algorithms. A step forward could see deep learning techniques such as LSTM used for such classification assignments.",

          "The convergence of quantum computing and economics represents a frontier in computational social science, promising to transform the modeling of uncertainty, complexity, and interdependence in financial and macroeconomic systems. This study explores how quantum computing methodologies—particularly quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum–classical frameworks—can be integrated into Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) modeling, stochastic simulations, and systemic risk analytics. By focusing on collaborative university–industry partnerships, the paper examines mechanisms that accelerate translational research, facilitate scalable experimentation, and bridge theoretical quantum advances with applied financial modeling. The analysis highlights how quantum-enhanced algorithms can improve the tractability and precision of multidimensional optimization problems inherent in macroeconomic forecasting and risk estimation. It also emphasizes the institutional value of joint academic–industrial infrastructures in fostering data sharing, interdisciplinary education, and early adoption of post-classical computing in finance. The findings suggest that hybridized quantum frameworks can substantially advance decision sciences, enabling resilient and adaptive economic systems capable of responding to global shocks with greater computational foresight.",
          "Traditional human civilizations have largely interpreted death as termination: an end-pointthat anchors legal, ethical, cultural, and scientific intuitions. This paper proposes an alternative,explicitly framed as a working theory: interpreting death as a wave phenomenon—the trans-formation and dispersion of embodied agency into persistent patterns of energy, information,and social-psychological resonance. We construct a conceptual scaffold called Wave Ontologyof Mortality (WOM), articulating three core ideas: (i) a Minimal Existence Core (MEC), thecompressed remainder of selfhood characterized by the primitive assertion “I exist”; (ii) AnchorWaves, persistent resonant traces arising from high-intensity affective or existential events; and(iii) Worldline Transition, the interpretation of death as a boundary-crossing between experientialtrajectories rather than annihilation. We analyze civilizational implications across governance,ethics, science, culture, and ritual practice, with particular attention to high-risk failure modes:moral hazard, self-harm contagion, criminal rationalization, authoritarian capture, and epistemiccult formation. Finally, we propose a research agenda spanning theoretical physics, quantuminformation, neuroscience, computational social science, and normative ethics, emphasizingfalsifiability where possible, and safety-by-design where not.Keywords: mortality, wave ontology, information theory, ethics of continuity, thanatology, civiliza-tional design, meaning systems, worldline transition",
          "ACM GROUP 2014 is the 18th International Conference on Supporting Group Work. ACM Group features deep multidisciplinary engagement of scholars across communities including Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Organization Science, Small Group Research, Computational Social Science, Sociotechnical System Design, Educational Technology and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. Group'14 continues the conference series' tradition of being truly international in both organizational structure and participation. This combination of diverse social and cultural research traditions and scholars from a wide range of disciplines undergirds the sustained discourse and continuing vibrancy of ACM Group. The Group'14 program includes work conducted using a range of research methods. Go to the sessions. Across the full program participants will discuss the latest findings within broad areas such as technology, society, and human interaction across a range of organizational contexts, including work practices, home, healthcare, and leisure. Group'14 especially encourages practitioners, industrial partners and academics to participate. This year, for the first time, the ACM Group program chairs introduce \"working papers\" as a discourse format. The aim is to build on the conferences core strength: At Conference Discourse Communities (ACDC's). Working papers are a formalization of ACDC's, focused on helping a set of participants develop journal papers through short presentations and active engagement with participants. Working paper authors will have a 10 minutes time slot to present their work and initiate conversation with attendees. Short talks to ignite deep discussion. We had 90 submissions and accepted 27 for a 30% acceptance rate. GROUP reviewing is conducted completely by the Program Committee members without external reviewers. In 2014 reviewing was conducted in two rounds. During the first round all committee members served exclusively as \"reviewers\". The goal of the first round was to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each paper and provided a structured review designed to help authors improve their papers. In the second round, one reviewer on each paper was assigned the \"Primary AC\" role and asked to lead an online discussion of the paper and write a Meta-Review based on the content of the reviews and the discussion. The goal of the discussion and Meta-Review is to generate a proposed accept/reject decision. The program co-chairs then considered all of the review scores and comments when making their final decisions. ACM Group is not an ordinary ACM Conference. We are small, and we are sustained by the unusual commitments of accomplished scholars. We theorize that this commitment emerges from the strengths outlined above. Many of our GROUP colleagues have generously contributed their time and effort to organize the conference, review papers, lead the Doctoral Colloquium, convene workshops, working papers, chair sessions, and be student volunteers. The conference would not be possible without their efforts. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!",
          "ABSTRACTThis study examined scholar distribution and mobility in the field of computational communication science (CCS). Two kinds of international mobilities in the educational stage (from bachelor education to PhD education) and occupational stage (from PhD education to current affiliation) were analysed at country levels. Social network analysis showed that the global knowledge production of CCS is still dominated by the Global North, especially the U.S. The two mobility patterns have the potential to contribute to Westernisation and brain circulation. The results from mixed models show that some origin and destination country variables can predict scholars’ mobility decisions.KEYWORDS: Scholar mobilityglobal knowledge flowbrain circulationcomputational communication sciencesocial network analysis Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationNotes on contributorsJingjing YiJingjing Yi(M.A. Syracuse University) is a Ph.D. student at the School of Journalism and Communication, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

          "We study two-sample variable selection: identifying variables that discriminate between the distributions of two sets of data vectors. Such variables help scientists understand the mechanisms behind dataset discrepancies. Although domain-specific methods exist (e.g., in medical imaging, genetics, and computational social science), a general framework remains underdeveloped. We make two separate contributions. (i) We introduce a mathematical notion of the discriminating set of variables: the largest subset containing no variables whose marginals are identical across the two distributions and independent of the remaining variables. We prove this set is uniquely defined and establish further properties, making it a suitable ground truth for theory and evaluation. (ii) We propose two methods for two-sample variable selection that assign weights to variables and optimise them to maximise the power of a kernel two-sample test while enforcing sparsity to downweight redundant variables. To select the regularisation parameter - unknown in practice, as it controls the number of selected variables - we develop two data-driven procedures to balance recall and precision. Synthetic experiments show improved performance over baselines, and we illustrate the approach on two applications using datasets from water-pipe and traffic networks.",

          "Abstract When the world’s countries agreed on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, they recognized that equity and inclusion should be at the center of implementing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 15, which calls for protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, has spurred commitments to restore 350 million hectares of land by 2030. These commitments, primarily made in a top-down manner at the international scale, must be implemented by actively engaging individual landholders and local communities. Ensuring that diverse and marginalized audiences are engaged in the land restoration movement is critical to equitably distributing the economic benefits of restoration. This publication uses social network analysis and machine learning to understand how important the voices of Africans, women, and young people are in governing restoration in Africa. We analyze location- and machine learning-identified demographics from Twitter data collected during the Global Landscapes Forum (GLF), which is the world’s largest platform for promoting sustainable land use practices. Our results suggest that convening the GLF in Nairobi, Kenya elevated the voices of African leaders in comparison to the previous GLF in Bonn, Germany. We also found significant demographic differences in topic-level engagement between different ages, races, and genders. The primary contributions of this paper are a novel methodology for quantifying demographic differences in social media engagement and the application of social media and social network analysis to provide critical insights into the inclusivity of a large political conference aimed at engaging youth and African voices.",
          "This article reviews the development of computational models of creativity where social interactions are central. We refer to this area as computational social creativity. Its context is described, including the broader study of creativity, the computational modeling of other social phenomena, and computational models of individual creativity. Computational modeling has been applied to a number of areas of social creativity and has the potential to contribute to our understanding of creativity. A number of requirements for computational models of social creativity are common in artificial life and computational social science simulations. Three key themes are identified: (1) computational social creativity research has a critical role to play in understanding creativity as a social phenomenon and advancing computational creativity by making clear epistemological contributions in ways that would be challenging for other approaches; (2) the methodologies developed in artificial life and computational social science carry over directly to computational social creativity; and (3) the combination of computational social creativity with individual models of creativity presents significant opportunities and poses interesting challenges for the development of integrated models of creativity that have yet to be realized.",
          "The Russo-Ukrainian war and the deterioration of the relationship between Russia and the West made the application of traditional social science research methods, such as surveys and fieldwork, difficult for researchers. It is likely that in the foreseeable future students of Russia will have to increasingly rely on the data that can be collected online. Using these data has defined the field of computational social science and has many analytical advantages and some limitations. This article provides a review of the sources of digital trace data for Russia and of the studies that used them for the analysis of political communication and behavior, education, labor markets, discrimination, and the Russo-Ukrainian war.",
          "The ultimate goal of the social sciences is to find a general social theory encompassing all aspects of social and collective phenomena. The traditional approach to this is very stringent by trying to find causal explanations and models. However, this approach has been recently criticized for preventing progress due to neglecting prediction abilities of models that support more problem-oriented approaches. The latter models would be enabled by the surge of big Web-data currently available. Interestingly, this problem cannot be overcome with methods from computational social science (CSS) alone because this field is dominated by simulation-based approaches and descriptive models. In this article, we address this issue and argue that the combination of big social data with social networks is needed for creating prediction models. We will argue that this alliance has the potential for gradually establishing a causal social theory. In order to emphasize the importance of integrating big social data with social networks, we call this approach data-driven computational social network science (DD-CSNS).",
          "Collective decision-making processes in political, administrative, and organizational contexts are often characterized less by a lack of information than by a structural conflation of heterogeneous contributions. Factual claims, opinions, preferences, procedural steps, and decisions frequently coexist within the same communicative and operational contexts without explicit differentiation, leading to reduced transparency, limited auditability, and difficulties in ex post reconstruction. This paper introduces the concept of nomology as a formal ordering framework for the structured description of collective decision processes. Nomology is defined as a system of explicitly specified categories, relations, and mechanisms that operate on a structural level prior to the application of concrete decision procedures or normative evaluations. Rather than prescribing outcomes or optimizing decisions, the proposed framework aims to make the roles, transitions, and dependencies within decision processes explicit and formally traceable. The paper delineates the core elements of a nomological framework, including fundamental contribution types, relational structures, and processual transitions, and clarifies its distinction from ontologies, explanatory theories, and normative programs. Furthermore, the relationship between nomology and existing approaches in science theory, social systems theory, computational social science, and explainable artificial intelligence is discussed. By providing a theory-agnostic and procedure-independent structural layer, nomology enables the systematic comparison, documentation, and auditability of collective decision processes across domains. The framework is proposed as an open research approach with potential applications in governance, organizational analysis, and the design of accountable socio-technical systems.",
          "Quantum computing introduces a revolutionary computational paradigm for social data analysis. Traditional social data processing methods face significant challenges in handling high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and dynamic datasets. Quantum computing, leveraging quantum superposition, entanglement, and parallel computation, provides efficient solutions for large-scale optimization, pattern recognition, and decision analysis. This paper systematically explores the applications of quantum computing in social sciences, covering theoretical foundations, methodological frameworks, experimental validations, and case studies to highlight the advantages of quantum algorithms in social network analysis, sentiment classification, and economic forecasting. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of quantum computing for social science research paradigms, ethical and governance concerns, and future development directions, emphasizing the integration of quantum computing with artificial intelligence. This paper aims to provide new insights into computational social science and advance the practical adoption of quantum computing in social data processing.",
          "Museum collection strategies are governed by a variety of factors, including topical focus, acquisition funds, availability of works in the art market, donations and specific coincidental opportunities. Yet, it remains unclear if more fundamental collection patterns emerge, exist, and are shared between museums, which could for example allow an established artist to estimate when a contemporary art museum would acquire their works. Here we collect and analyze data from 12 European contemporary art museums, taking into account artwork creation dates, collection acquisition dates, and the associated artist age at both points in time. From this simple quantitative construct we are able to reveal a striking gradient of museum profiles at the aggregate level. This lag can function to constitute a macroeconomic index of \"mean museum collection lag\", ranging from 3 years in the most dynamic cases (Kiasma) to 35 years in the most established institutions (Museo Reina Sofía). Meanwhile, on the granular level, plotting artist age over collection year, and using artist-age vs artwork-collection matrices, a detailed picture becomes evident, where individual museums are characterized by shared patterns and a rich heterogeneity of ideographic details. Regularities include continuous acquisitions, systematic acquisition of older materials over time, and brief bursts, where whole oeuvres of individual artists join specific collections. Hence, we are able to shed light on the detailed collection history of museums, transcending the anecdotal nature of art historical storytelling via the provision of a quantitative context. Our approach of cultural data analysis combines expertise in art, art history, computational social science, and computer science. Our joint perspective builds a bridge between and serves an audience of museum professionals, art market actors, collectors, and individual artists alike.",
          "Current state-of-the-art in big social data analytics is largely limited to graph theoretical approaches such as social network analysis (SNA) informed by the social philosophical approach of relational sociology. This paper proposes and illustrates an alternate holistic approach to big social data analytics, social set analysis (SSA), which is based on the sociology of associations, mathematics of set theory, and advanced visual analytics of event studies. We illustrate our new approach by applying it to relate real-world events with their reflections in terms of user interactions on social media platforms. We present and discuss a theoretical and conceptual model of social data followed by a formal description of our technique based on set theory and event studies with a real-world social data example from Facebook. We then illustrate our new approach by reporting on the design, development, and evaluation results of a state-of-the-art visual analytics dashboard, the Social Set Visualizer (SoSeVi). Using SoSeVi, we conducted a real-world case study that consists of approximately 90 million Facebook user interactions from 11 different companies that have been mentioned in the traditional media in relation to the garment factory accidents in Bangladesh, and analyze the results. The enterprise application domain for the dashboard is corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the targeted end-users are CSR researchers and practitioners. The design of the dashboard was based on the social set analysis approach to computational social science mentioned above. The development of the dashboard involved cutting-edge open source visual analytics libraries (D3.js) and creation of new visualizations such as of actor mobility across time and space, conversational comets, and more. Evaluation of the dashboard consisted of technical testing, usability testing, and domain-specific testing with CSR students and yielded positive results. In conclusion, we discuss the new analytical- approach of social set analysis and conclude with a discussion of the benefits of set theoretical approaches based on the social philosophical approach of associational sociology.",
          "Digitalization and its impact on the practices of scientific prevision and everyday predictive practices, as well as on the strategies of scientific and everyday cogni­tion, is a problem that is increasingly widely discussed both in scientific circles and on public platforms. The article clarifies what is meant by the process of dig­italization and how it turns out in relation to scientific activity. It’s substantiated that the rapid progress of forecasting as a strategy of scientific foresight over the last century is due to both the growth of the capabilities of applied mathemat­ics and the departure from the modern project of science as unlimited in its pre­dictive capabilities. As a result, obtaining predictions based on laws is supple­mented, and in some areas, replaced by the practice of prevision “beyond the limit of predictability” – by identifying quasi-regularities based on empirical information characterizing the behavior of the object. Despite the fact that pre­dictive activity is formed primarily by quantitative methods, by the 1970s their limitations in the field of social processes are recognized. The limitations are due to the complexity of collecting and, as a consequence, the lack of empirical in­formation, and digitalization leads to a better representation of social processes by fixing their course in the digital environment. All this information can be ac­cumulated and processed thanks to big data technologies, which leads to the emer­gence of a computational social science project. It is shown that this project is in­tegrated into a broader theoretical and cognitive initiative of the new empiricism, which calls for abandoning theories as a less effective way of ordering empirical information and moving from actual facts to the facts of possible experience, re­placing them with more effective – calculations based on big data. The existing arguments against the ideas of new empiricism are analyzed, and it is concluded that in addition to big data, other risks associated with the use of artificial intelli­gence in scientific cognition should be analyzed.",
          "Advances in digital technology have led to the digitization of everyday activities of billions of people around the world, generating vast amounts of data on human behavior.

As they are recent and emerging developments, many behavioral scientists and practitioners may be unaware or unfamiliar with these recent developments and opportunities to extract behavioral insights. The main objective of this article is to discuss machine learning methods for researchers and practitioners interested in addressing customer-relevant questions using new secondary data sources that are publicly available, such as data from crowdfunding, video streaming, crowdsourcing, and social media platforms.

          "Marr’s levels of analysis constitute one influential approach tothe central program of cognitive science—the multilevel anal-ysis of cognition as information processing. The distinctiveaspects of Marr’s framework are an emphasis on identifyingthe computational problems and constraints faced in cognition,and conceptual machinery to relate cognitive mechanisms tothat computational level of analysis. Although related ideashave been explored in a range of social science disciplines,Marr’s framework, and particularly its notion of the preciseformulation of computational problems and solutions, has yetto be applied widely in social analysis. In the present workwe develop a formulation of Marr’s levels for social systems,provide examples of this approach, and address potential criti-cisms. The consequence is a computational perspective on thesociological school of structural functionalism, and an appara-tus for conducting multiscale analysis of social systems.",
          "ABSTRACTThe OECD is a key player in global education policy advice and part of the edu-business network. This network comprises of companies, philanthropies, consulting agencies and think tanks profiting from educational governance reforms and large-scale testing. This article investigates the structure of the OECD global policy network and its capability to bring together different types of expertise. To map the global policy advisors network, we introduce the concepts of boundary-spanning actors and field-crossing social capital. Using network analysis, we apply these concepts to investigate the embeddedness of the OECD in different social fields and the global field of power. Our findings indicate that the global network of policy advisors coordinates different forms of expertise by installing a system of patronage, consisting of a small number of key players and large numbers of actors that set education reforms in motion. We exemplify this result with McKinsey & Company.摘要经合组织是全球教育政策咨询的关键参与者，也是教育-商业网络的组成部分。该网络由企业、慈善组织、咨询机构和智库组成，并从教育治理改革和大规模测试中获利。本文考察经合组织全球政策网络的结构及其整合不同类别专业知识的能力。为绘制全球政策顾问网络，我们引入跨边界者和跨场域社会资本的概念。并通过社会网络分析，进而考察经合组织在不同社会场域及全球权力场域中的嵌入程度。结果表明，全球政策网络中的顾问们通过建立一个赞助体系以整合不同类型的专业知识，该体系由推动教育变革的少数关键角色和大量参与者组成。我们以麦肯锡公司为例对此进行说明。KEYWORDS: OECDPISAglobal field of powerfield-crossing social capitalhabitus-field theorysocial network analysis关键词: 经合组织国际学生评估项目全球权力场域跨场域社会资本惯习–场域理论社会网络分析 Data availability statementThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Disclosure statementAll authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.

          "In this essay we make four interrelated points. First, we reiterate previous arguments (Kleinberg et al 2015) that forecasting problems are more common in social science than is often appreciated. From this observation it follows that social scientists should care about predictive accuracy in addition to unbiased or consistent estimation of causal relationships. Second, we argue that social scientists should be interested in prediction even if they have no interest in forecasting per se. Whether they do so explicitly or not, that is, causal claims necessarily make predictions; thus it is both fair and arguably useful to hold them accountable for the accuracy of the predictions they make. Third, we argue that prediction, used in either of the above two senses, is a useful metric for quantifying progress. Important differences between social science explanations and machine learning algorithms notwithstanding, social scientists can still learn from approaches like the Common Task Framework (CTF) which have successfully driven progress in certain fields of AI over the past 30 years (Donoho, 2015). Finally, we anticipate that as the predictive performance of forecasting models and explanations alike receives more attention, it will become clear that it is subject to some upper limit which lies well below deterministic accuracy for many applications of interest (Martin et al 2016). Characterizing the properties of complex social systems that lead to higher or lower predictive limits therefore poses an interesting challenge for computational social science.",

          "This study explores the Iranian public’s perception of economic inflation, emphasizing the representation and subsequent attitudes across different commodity categories. Using data from X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram between October 2022 and November 2023, this study applies quantitative content and sentiment analyses on over 6.3 million posts, comparing social-media representation with official inflation data. Computational social science methods, such as data mining, facilitated the data collection. The results reveal a hierarchy of representation: capital commodities (housing, cars, and gold) receiving the most attention, followed by essential and lastly non-essential ones, with little to no consistent correlation between inflation rate and representation. A negative binomial regression confirms that inflation itself is not a significant predictor of public attention, while commodity type, particularly capital commodities, exerts a strong independent effect. Sentiment analysis shows that positive reactions to capital commodity inflation exceed those for essential by a factor of 5.1 and non-essential by 18. Therefore, the emphasis on capital commodities is not merely a response to living-cost crisis or perceptual bias, but reflects collective economic memory and experience under a rentier-crony capitalist system. In this Global South context, speculative behaviors towards capital commodities emerge as a socially-reinforced survival strategy to preserve wealth.",
          "Social groups and identities play a central role in social research, yet systematically identifying the symbolic markers that define group boundaries can be difficult, particularly in large, unlabeled textual corpora. This article advances an existing technique for computational lexicon extraction, the ``frequency-based'' method, to automatically identify cultural and social identity signals at scale, even in the absence of reliable labeled data. By leveraging a small set of highly representative ``seed'' terms to assign low-quality labels, the approach locates authors who share specialized vocabularies, thereby revealing dense patterns of boundary-specific words. In accordance with computational grounded theory (CGT), which stresses iterative refinement informed by interpretive insight, selecting appropriate seed terms requires considerable knowledge of the groups under observation prior to lexicon extraction. A companion study also published in this volume illustrates the technique’s effectiveness in mapping the symbolic boundaries of white nationalist discourse on Twitter, highlighting how automated lexicon extraction can feed directly into traditional qualitative practices such as close reading and manual coding. The discussion situates this mixed-methods approach within the framework of computational grounded theory while challenging the presupposition—implicit in CGT and computational social science more broadly—that the use of computational tools must culminate in quantitative analyses. Instead, this approach demonstrates how natural language processing can serve as an upstream step that enriches and expedites qualitative inquiry by revealing hidden patterns and vocabularies that might otherwise remain invisible to traditional ethnography. In this way, computational approaches to text are positioned not as replacements but as catalysts for deeper, more nuanced qualitative research.",
          "Machine learning and other computer-driven prediction models are one of the fastest growing trends in computational social science. These methods and approaches were developed in computer science and with different goals and epistemologies than those in social science. The most obvious difference being a focus on prediction versus explanation. Predictive modeling offers great potential for improving research and theory development, but its adoption poses some challenges and creates new problems. For this reason, Hofman et al. (2021) published recommendations for more effective integration of predictive modeling into social science. In this communication I review their recommendations and expand on some additional concerns related to current practices and whether prediction can effectively serve the goals of most social scientists. Overall, I argue they provide a sound set of guidelines and a classification scheme that will serve those of us working in computational social science.",
          "The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data analysis algorithms is complementary to theory-driven analysis approaches and becoming more popular also in social sciences. This paper describes the use of Big Data and computational approaches in social sciences by bibliometric analyses of articles indexed between 2015 and 2020 in Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of the Web of Science repository. We have analysed especially the recent research direction called Computational Social Sciences (CSS) that bridges computer analytical approaches with social science challenges, generating new methodologies of Big Data and AI analytics for social sciences. The results indicate that AI and Big Data practices are not confined to CSS only and are diffused in a wide variety of disciplines under Social Sciences and are made use of in many main research lines as well. Thus, the anticipated overlap between the Social Sciences &amp; AI specialization and CSS has yet to be crystallised. Moreover, the impact of computational social science studies is not permeated to social science citation networks yet. Lastly, we demonstrate that the AI and Big Data publications that appear under the SSCI index are more oriented towards computational studies than addressing social science concepts, concerns, and challenges.",

          "Social scientists, political scientists, economists, and healthcare researchers crucially rely on statistical methods to further the study of individuals, society, and human behavior via inferential analysis. Unfortunately, the naive application and release of resulting statistics could reveal sensitive information about the individuals in the dataset. As a result, we propose and analyze rigorous privacy-preserving methods while showing the limits of such methods either mathematically and/or empirically. The main definition of privacy we will rely on is Differential Privacy (DP). In this thesis, we make algorithmic and analytic contributions to fundamental computational social science methods (such as linear regression and rank aggregation): 1) DP Statistical Prediction: We prove finite-sample convergence rates for a range of DP ordinary least squares methods. Then, we propose methods, based on nonparametric estimators, that perform well---in terms of minimizing prediction loss---when the dataset size is small. We show, experimentally, that the optimal method interpolates between a nonparametric estimator and a parametric one. In particular, for at least one of the methods proposed, the noise due to privacy will be less than the sampling error for common settings of parameters. 2) DP Uncertainty Quantification: We prove that a differentially private F-statistic converges to the asymptotic distribution of the non-private F-statistic, the chi-squared distribution. In addition, we obtain the optimal 1/sqrt(n) asymptotic convergence rates for resulting DP sufficient statistics. Using the DP F-statistic and a parametric bootstrap, we construct DP hypothesis tests for testing for a linear relationship and testing for the presence of mixtures. Through experiments, we also show when the DP F-statistic outperforms alternative methods for DP hypothesis testing. 3) DP Rank Aggregation: In social choice theory, (Kemeny) rank aggregation is a well-studied problem where the goal is to combine rankings from multiple voters into a single ranking on the same set of items. Since rankings can reveal preferences of voters (which a voter might like to keep private), it is important to aggregate preferences in such a way to preserve privacy. We present DP algorithms for rank aggregation in the pure and approximate settings along with distribution-independent utility upper and lower bounds. In addition to bounds in the central model, we also present utility bounds for the local model of differential privacy.",
          "Computational social science is an emerging field at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and the social sciences. This paper addresses the philosophical foundations of this new field. Kant and Peirce provide an understanding of scientific objectivity as intersubjective validity. Modern mathematics, and especially the mathematics of algorithms and statistics, get their objectivity from the intersubjective validity of formal proof. Algorithms implementing statistical inference, or scientific algorithms , are what distinguish computational social science epistemically from other social sciences. This gives computational social science an objective validity that other social sciences do not have. Objections to the scientific realism of this philosophy from the positions of anti-instrumentalism, postmodern interpretivism, and situated epistemology are considered and either incorporated into this philosophy of computational social science or refuted. Speculative predictions for the field of computational social science are offered in conclusion: computational social science will bring about an end of narrative in the social sciences, contract the field of social scientific knowledge into a narrower, more hierarchical field of expertise, and create a democratic crisis that will only be resolved through universal education in computational statistics.

          "This paper takes Friedrich Engels 200th birthday on 28 November 2020 as occasion to ask: How relevant are Friedrich Engels’s works in the age of digital capitalism? It shows that Engels class-struggle oriented theory can and should inform 21st century social science and digital social research. Based on a reading of Engels’s works, the article discusses how to think of scientific socialism as critical social science today, presents a critique of computational social science as digital positivism, engages with foundations of digital labour analysis, the analysis of the international division of digital labour, updates Engels’s Condition of the Working Class in England in the age of digital capitalism, analyses the role of trade unions and digital class struggles in digital age, analyses the social murder of workers in the COVID-19 crisis, engages with platform co-operatives, digital commons projects and public service Internet platforms as concrete digital utopias that point beyond digital capital(ism). Engels’s analysis is updated for critically analysing the digital conditions of the working class today, including the digital labour of hardware assemblers at Foxconn and Pegatron, the digital labour aristocracy of software engineers at Google, online freelance workers, platform workers at capitalist platform corporations such as Uber, Deliveroo, Fiverr, Upwork, or Freelancer, and the digital labour of Facebook users.

          "Social science is critical to decision making at the policy level. Software modelling and simulation are innovative computational methods that provide alternative means of developing and testing theory relevant to policy decisions. Software modelling is capable of dealing with obstacles often encountered in traditional social science research, such as the difficulty of performing real-world experimentation. As a relatively new science, computational research in the social sciences faces significant challenges, both in terms of methodology and acceptance. However, there is great potential for computing to aid in the application of scientific thinking to the grave issues facing society. This is particularly true since technological advances and societal change continue to make our lives more complex. Policy decisions can have significant impacts in the lives of those affected; it is imperative we strive to develop novel and effective methods to inform these decisions. This thesis focuses on the interaction of modelling, software development, and experimentation in computational social science research pursued by small teams of interdisciplinary scientists. I present an innovative software development framework designed for this kind of research. By integrating software throughout the research process for both modelling and experimentation, and utilizing a flexible and iterative development model, my framework addresses many pressing issues of computational social science: uncertainty due to lack of data or changing conditions; validation of models; usability; rapid adjustment to changes in direction; facilitating collaboration; and communication of results to peers and stakeholders. Case studies of projects developed using this software modelling framework are used to illustrate and discuss the approach.

          "Studying corruption presents unique challenges. Recent work in the spirit of computational social science exploits newly available data and methods to give a fresh perspective on this important topic. In this chapter we highlight some of these works, describing how they provide insights into classic social scientific questions about the structure and dynamics of corruption in society from micro to macro scales. We argue that corruption is fruitfully understood as a collective action problem that happens between embedded people and organizations. Computational methods like network science and agent-based modeling can give insights into such situations. We also present various (big) data sources that have been exploited to study corruption. We conclude by highlighting work in adjacent fields, for instance on the problems of collusion, tax evasion, organized crime, and the darkweb, and promising avenues for future work.",
          "Digitization led to an enormous increase in the availability of visual data. As images are an important aspect of human communication, decades of social science research have analysed images, yet in mostly manual fashion with limited scaling capacities. In this work, we outline how recent advances in computer vision enable automated image analysis, allowing researchers to further unlock the potential of digital behavioural data. We introduce the field of computational social science and conduct a literature review of early studies using image recognition. We also highlight important aspects to be considered, such as computational demands and biases of computer vision models. Furthermore, in a case study, we examine the online behaviour of U.S. Members of Congress during the early COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In particular, we focus on sharing images showing face masks as they are a crucial aspect of health and safety measures during the pandemic. Using Instagram data and models for detecting face masks, we find that temporal dynamics and party affiliation play a substantial role in the likelihood of sharing images of people wearing face masks: images with masks are more often posted after the introduction of mask mandates and Democratic party members are more likely to share images with masks. In addition, we find somewhat weaker to no differences regarding the age and gender of politicians.",

          "Complex systems consist of a large number of elements that interact in a non-trivial way; for example the human brain, society, Internet, and biological organisms can all be modelled as complex systems. Complex systems can be naturally represented as networks, mathematical objects that consist of nodes and edges connecting these nodes, and the study of large networks based on empirical data has become known as complex networks. Since the first articles on complex networks appeared in the end of the 1990's, various technological, biological, and social networks have been analyzed. In recent years introductory text books on the subject have also been published. \\nThe study of social networks of course has a longer history. Small social networks have been studied for decades in sociology, social psychology and anthropology, and the influence that social networks have on both performance and well being of individuals has been well documented. The availability of electronic communication records—mobile phone calls, emails, online social networking sites and even multiplayer computer games—have changed the scale and detail at which social networks can be analyzed. The largest data set studied so far includes over 700 million individuals, and the mobile phone call records studied in this Thesis contain information of over 6 million people. The combination of powerful computers and large data sets have enabled the emergence of computational social science.\\nSeveral aspects of large social networks are studied in this Thesis. Models of social networks are commonly used as a way to gain insight about the structure of these networks. The first article studies a number of models suggested for social networks and discusses their advantages and shortcomings. The community structure of various networks has also been a subject of great interest. It is widely accepted that nearly all networks have modular structure, evidenced by local densifications of connectivity. However, identifying communities in empirical data has turned out to be difficult both theoretically and in practice. We apply three state-of-art community detections methods to a large social network and evaluate the quality of the identified communities. One important aspect of human interactions is omitted when analyzing networks: time. Temporal networks have become a common framework for studying data sets where the relations between nodes vary with time, and this framework can be readily applied to study mobile phone calls. The last part of this Thesis introduces the concept of temporal motifs—recurring patterns of events in temporal networks—that can be used to analyze the meso-scale structure of temporal networks.",

          "Many applications of computational social science aim to infer causal conclusions from non-experimental data. Such observational data often contains confounders, variables that influence both potential causes and potential effects. Unmeasured or latent confounders can bias causal estimates, and this has motivated interest in measuring potential confounders from observed text. For example, an individual's entire history of social media posts or the content of a news article could provide a rich measurement of multiple confounders. Yet, methods and applications for this problem are scattered across different communities and evaluation practices are inconsistent. This review is the first to gather and categorize these examples and provide a guide to data-processing and evaluation decisions. Despite increased attention on adjusting for confounding using text, there are still many open problems, which we highlight in this paper.",

The possibilities for unlocking longstanding questions about children and media are thrilling, but the path forward is complicated by questions about epistemology, data, ethics and training. In this essay, I outline the promise and peril of computational social science for children and media research, drawing on advances from related fields to offer suggestions for researchers hoping to make use of big data and computational analytics.",
          "The hipster paradox in Electronic Dance Music is the phenomenon that commercial success is collectively considered illegitimate while serious and aspiring professional musicians strive for it. We study this behavioral dilemma using digital traces of performing live and releasing music as they are stored in the Resident Advisor, Juno Download, and Discogs databases from 2001-2018. We construct network snapshots following a formal sociological approach based on bipartite networks, and we use network positions to explain success in regression models of artistic careers. We find evidence for a structural trade-off among autonomy and success. Musicians in EDM embed into exclusive performance-based communities for autonomy but, in earlier career stages, seek the mainstream for commercial success. Our approach highlights how Computational Social Science can benefit from a close connection of data analysis and theory.",
          "BRIEF SESSION DESCRIPTION: Learn to prepare students for interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary work. This panel will explore and discuss the nature of crossdisciplinary work students may experience in their academic and professional careers, and introduce how experienced teachers of interdisciplinary courses engage their students in multi-faceted research here at Mason. ________________________________________________________________ FULL ABSTRACT: Most big problems facing humanity (give examples to the audience: Climate Change, understanding the Brain and Consciousness, Computational Social Science, and the future challenges as humanity moves into space) are multifaceted, interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary (define these for audience). Also, as in any field of scholarship that involves basic research, the key developments that move a field forward typically come from unexpected directions (e.g. the internet, materials science, etc.). Furthermore, research in these highly interdisciplinary realms typically involves working in large teams of highly varied experts. How do you teach and train students to be aware of the large context in which they will be working in the future and at the same time give the students sufficient depth of understanding in a specific field so that they can make significant contributions to such projects?Â This session will be a short presentation (15 mins) providing definitions and an overview of the nature of interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary work, followed by a panel discussion on the opportunities and challenges of training students in interdisciplinary fields of research. The panel will include people who have substantial experience in teaching interdisciplinary courses and engaging in such multi-faceted research at Mason. Panelists include: Michael Summers (Astrobiology ASTR 301: Teaching the most interdisciplinary of all of the sciences: The origin, evolution, and future of life in the universe) For more information about teaching in the disciplines:Â https://stearnscenter.gmu.edu/teaching/teaching-in-the-disciplines For session spacific materials, please request directly from the presenter Mike Summers:Â msummers@gmu.edu",

          "This paper provides a comprehensive formal dynamical-systems account of romantic dissolution in long-term partnerships. Marriage is modelled as a two-agent cooperative system whose persistence depends on the non-empty and dynamically invariant intersection of the partners' individual viability sets. Drawing on the Unified Structural Theory of Complex Systems, the framework formalises ten mechanisms of interest attrition and shows that each can be represented as a special case of a general structural law. The ten core mechanisms analysed are: (1) viability mismatch, (2) reward-signal adaptation (biochemical habituation), (3) Quasi-Westermarck familiarity-induced suppression, (4) constraint–autonomy imbalance, (5) social contagion of dissolution norms, (6) economic cost–benefit asymmetries, (7) children as viability-set anchors, (8) media and social media norm distortion, (9) perceptual valence switching, and (10) serial monogamy as parameter renewal. Beyond these core mechanisms, the paper develops several extended analyses that situate romantic dissolution within broader biological, cultural, technological, legal, institutional, and normative contexts: Evolutionary context: Comparative primate mating systems, the phylogenetic origins of social monogamy, Fisher's \"four-year itch\" hypothesis, and the adaptive logic of serial monogamy across 58 societies. Children: trauma, intergenerational transmission, and instrumentalisation. An expanded treatment of children as the most consequential stakeholders in the dissolution process. Parental divorce is situated within the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) framework (Felitti et al., 1998; Merrick et al., 2018), with Amato's meta-analytic evidence on child outcome deficits across academic, psychological, and social domains. The intergenerational transmission of divorce (\"the divorce cycle\") is formalised through three channels: interpersonal behaviour deficits (the largest mediator), insecure attachment working models, and attitudinal normalisation of dissolution. Developmental pathways from childhood adversity to adult personality pathology are classified by their effects on the agent's parameter vector: anxious attachment (hypervigilance and autonomy contraction), avoidant attachment (emotional withdrawal and underinvestment), disorganised attachment (high-amplitude extractive oscillation), and externalising pathology (substance abuse, conduct disorder). A final subsection analyses the strategic instrumentalisation of children — parental alienation as epistemic attack, deployment of children as informants, and emotional extortion through custody leverage. Digital disruption: High-fidelity pornography and reward-threshold inflation, AI companion chatbots as synthetic alternative attractors, dating applications and the paradox of infinite perceived alternatives, consensual non-monogamy as system dimensionality expansion, and companion animals as partial attachment substitutes. Extractive oscillator dynamics as a continuum: Drawing on the formal extractive oscillator framework (Kriger, 2026), the paper argues that quasi-narcissistic dynamics are not a categorical pathology but a universal feature of intimate dyads, varying across couples only in degree, amplitude, and asymmetry. An asymmetry index is introduced and three structural regimes are characterised. Religion and secularisation: A cross-religious analysis (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism) of marriage as sacred institution, formalising the \"sacred exit barrier\" as a transcendent cost component. The progressive removal of this barrier through secularisation is modelled as the elimination of the historically dominant stabilisation mechanism. The legal system as structural force: A game-theoretic analysis of adversarial family law as a prisoner's dilemma that selects for mutual aggression over cooperative settlement. The section formalises temporal distortion (forced residence in non-viable state space during prolonged proceedings), financial extraction as secondary dissolution, custody weaponisation, jurisdictional arbitrariness as exogenous stochastic perturbation, the no-fault revolution as the legal analogue of secularisation, and mediation/collaborative divorce as mechanism-design interventions. The Nash bargaining solution for cooperative dissolution is derived. Same-sex dyads: A demonstration that the viability framework requires no structural modification for same-sex couples — the mechanisms are identical, only the empirical parameter values differ. Dissolution-rate asymmetries between female–female, male–male, and different-sex couples are interpreted through exit-barrier levels, constraint–autonomy dynamics, threshold asymmetries, and minority stress as exogenous viability-set contraction. Drawing on Kurdek's longitudinal programme and Scandinavian registry data. Domestic violence, institutional response, and strategic weaponisation. Genuine intimate partner violence formalised as high-amplitude extractive oscillation with three artificial exit-barrier mechanisms (terror, epistemic degradation, resource control). Comparative institutional analysis: Russia's 2017 decriminalisation as protective-barrier removal (with HRW, Wilson Center, and CEPA documentation); the United States' mandatory arrest paradoxes (Sherman's Milwaukee experiment showing 64% increased victim mortality after arrest; Campbell's femicide risk factors); Canada's mandatory charging and unintended victim criminalisation. Strategic weaponisation of allegations formalised as first-mover advantage in a game-theoretic framework, with empirical evidence from Bala et al. (2007) and Meier (2019). The dual crisis of under-protection and over-intervention identified as a common structural failure: one-dimensional binary classification where multi-dimensional assessment is required. Precursors of dissolution: Integration of Gottman's 40-year empirical programme (the Four Horsemen, cascade model, two-factor dissolution timing) with the viability framework, yielding a seven-step structured diagnostic hierarchy. The normative question: A balanced treatment of whether marriages should be \"saved\" or dissolution accepted as the evolutionary norm, with five structural projections for the future of intimate partnership over the next two to five decades. The mathematical framework employs viability theory, coupled differential equations, phase-transition models, game theory (prisoner's dilemma, Nash bargaining), attachment theory formalisation, and sigmoid threshold dynamics. Seven black-and-white TikZ figures illustrate viability-set geometry, reward decay, the Quasi-Westermarck curve, exit-barrier collapse, the mechanism-to-control-variable wheel, and parameter sweep sensitivity analyses. Five tables summarise control variables, testable predictions, model comparisons, cross-domain correspondences, and case vignettes. The resulting framework reinterprets \"loss of love\" not as an emotional or moral failure but as a structurally constrained trajectory in the parameter space of a dyadic persistence system — one shaped by deterministic tendencies but subject to irreducible stochastic and agentive variability.

          "Increasingly, people around the globe use Social Media (SM) - e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, Youtube - to publish multimedia content (posting), to share it (retweeting, reblogging or resharing), to reinforce it or not (liking, disliking, favoriting) and to discuss (through messages and comments) in order to be in contact with other users and to get informed about topics of interest. The world population is ? 7:4 billion people, among them ? 2:3 billion (31%) are active social media users (GlobalWeb Index data, Jan 2016). In fact, these virtual contexts answer the human need of aggregation that nowadays is translated into digital bonds among peers all over the world, in addition to the traditional face-to-face relationships. Online Social Networks (OSNs), then, provide a space for user aggregation in groups, expressing opinions, accessing information, contributing to public debates, and participating in the formation of belief systems. In this context, communities are built around different topics of interaction and polarized sub-groups often emerge by clustering different opinions and points of view. Such polarized sub-groups can be tracked and monitored over time in an automatic way and the analysis of their interactions is interesting to shed light on the human social behavior. Even though many studies have been devoted to understand different aspects of the social network structure and its function, such as, community structure (For10), information spreading (BRMA12), information seeking (KLPM10), link prediction (LNK07), etc., much less work is available on analyzing online discussions, user opinion and public debates. In this doctoral dissertation we analyze the concept of polarization by looking at interactions among users in different Online Social Networks. Polarization is a social process whereby a social group is divided into sub-communities discussing different topics and having different opinions, goals and viewpoints, often conflicting and contrasting (Sun02; Ise86). We are interested in studying how and to what extend it is possible to extract information about polarized communities by automatically processing the data about interactions created in Online Social Networks. We present the state of the art and we propose a novel detecting method which allows to identify polarized groups, track them and monitor the topic evolution in the discussion among users of an OSN over time by classifing the keywords used in the messages exchanged. We show that it improves the state of the art and we describe case studies conducted particularly on Twitter (CLOP16; CGGL17). The benefits in understanding user opinions are detailed in the first chapters. Moreover, we use the proposed methodology and alternatives in different application contexts: misinformation (BCD+14a; BCD+14b; BCD+15), politics (CLOP16; CLOP15; CLO+15), social behaviors (CALS16a; CALS16b), and migrations (CLM+16). A further application of opinion mining is the task of predicting user behavior. We discuss the limitations and the challenges related to this research area by looking at the context of political elections and by digging into a case study of electoral prediction. We believe that the analysis of polarized communities is OSNs can be used to predict collective social behavior, but major improvements in the field can be achieved by integrating several sources of information, such as traditional surveys, multiple Online Social Networks, demographic data, historical information, events, cyber-physical data. Therefore, polarization is integrated in a framework of analysis with other dimensions (time, location) to explore social phenomena from a social media perspective. In particular, we look at the possibility to understand European perception of the political refugees' crises by mining OSN data. The concept of polarization is related to that of controversy. Controversy describes the interaction among two or more opponent polarized communities that discuss together, often with heated tones. For some highly controversial topics (e.g., politics, religion, ethics) even though users prefer to get informed though polarized content originated in the communities they belong to, they like to share their affiliations, believes, ideals, convictions with external users in order to persuade them in joining their belief system or supporting, criticizing an event, a group, a party or a specific person. Highly polarization does not always imply controversy and vice versa. We describe the recent literature about controversy detection and we propose a machine learning approach which takes into account features related to the social network and to conversational interaction patterns. The model is able to identify controversy in a conversation without any feature related to the content of the interaction. The features are deeply analyzed and the accuracy of the model is discussed. We finally explore two opposite situations. The first is the formation of echo chambers, where a user gets informed and gives opinions in a self-contained group, whose members share a similar point of view. By analyzing communities in Facebook which consume news from scientific pages and from pages focused on conspiracy theories we confirm the hypothesis of cognitive closure of the users, weakening the idea of Social Media as a space for democratic collective intelligence. The second is the presence of deviant communities. Those are communities that emerge around what are usually referred to as deviant behaviors (CM15), conducts that are commonly considered inappropriate because they violate society's norms or moral standards. An example of deviant behavior is the pornography consumption, that is the focus of our examination looking at content dissemination in Online Social Networks. Deviant communities are commonly considered segregated but we show that instead their content might spread far away in the Online Social Network. We analyze both situations with real case studies using Facebook, Flickr, and Tumblr data. Our work is an initial study of opinion polarization on Online Social Networks with some in-depth analyses of specific topical user communities. It brings novel contributions in: i) characterizing communities through the perspective of user polarization; ii) proposing a novel method to classify polarized users and topic evolution over time; iii) understanding user behavior from a social media perspective; iv) integrating polarization with other variables (time, space) with the purpose of analyzing a social phenomenon; v) defining controversy and how to detect it regardless of the content; vi) describing how people aggregate and share information in various contexts. Different topical communities and several OSNs are described in the dissertation, providing a general overview of the investigation field and proposing contributions to the discussion and solutions. Our research questions are part of a broader research area which is called Computational Social Science. This new discipline - which is the frame of our thesis - is a new approach to social studies by mean of novel large-scale computational tools, merging Social Science with Computer Science and Machine Learning.",
          "If computational social science is to find practical application in informing policy decisions and proportionately analyzing courses of action, then it will have to make progress in the area of composition of social models.  Since a single simulation cannot hold a world of information, policy makers need to switch in and out modules in federations of simulations to test policies against all possible social environments.  Voting processes as they occur in nature, both in the form of cognition in a human mind of disparate world views, and in the form of equilibria seeking coevolution of species, inform how to combine model results externally and deeply, respectively.  These algorithms, which use the same principles of soft computation found in nature, enable any models to mesh together, even if they have different ontologies, or their data conflict, regardless of the degree they overlap.  A whiteboard architecture in which models report in their own ontologies how other models may inform them and what they have to offer other models, is a framework for the arbitrary meshing of social models.",
          "This study explores the Iranian public’s perception of economic inflation, emphasizing the representation and subsequent attitudes across different commodity categories. Using data from X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram between October 2022 and November 2023, this study applies quantitative content and sentiment analyses on over 6.3 million posts, comparing social-media representation with official inflation data. Computational social science methods, such as data mining, facilitated the data collection. The results reveal a hierarchy of representation: capital commodities (housing, cars, and gold) receiving the most attention, followed by essential and lastly non-essential ones, with little to no consistent correlation between inflation rate and representation. A negative binomial regression confirms that inflation itself is not a significant predictor of public attention, while commodity type, particularly capital commodities, exerts a strong independent effect. Sentiment analysis shows that positive reactions to capital commodity inflation exceed those for essential by a factor of 5.1 and non-essential by 18. Therefore, the emphasis on capital commodities is not merely a response to living-cost crisis or perceptual bias, but reflects collective economic memory and experience under a rentier-crony capitalist system. In this Global South context, speculative behaviors towards capital commodities emerge as a socially-reinforced survival strategy to preserve wealth.",
          "Different agreement scores are widely used in social computing studies to evaluate the reliability of crowdsourced ratings. In this research, we argue that the concept of agreement is problematic for many rating tasks in computational social science because they are characterized by subjectivity. We demonstrate this claim by analyzing four social computing datasets that are rated by crowd workers, showing that the agreement ratings are low despite deploying proper instructions and platform settings. Findings indicate that the more subjective the rating task, the lower the agreement, suggesting that tasks differ by their inherent subjectivity and that measuring the agreement of social computing tasks might not be the optimal way to ensure data quality. When creating subjective tasks, the use of agreement metrics potentially gives a false picture of the consistency of crowd workers, as they over-simplify the reality of obtaining quality labels. We also provide empirical evidence on the stability of crowd ratings with a different number of raters, items, and categories, finding that the reliability scores are most sensitive to the number categories, somewhat less sensitive to the number of raters, and the least sensitive to the number of items. Our findings have implications for computational social scientists using crowdsourcing for data collection.",
          "Collective decision-making processes in political, administrative, and organizational contexts are often characterized less by a lack of information than by a structural conflation of heterogeneous contributions. Factual claims, opinions, preferences, procedural steps, and decisions frequently coexist within the same communicative and operational contexts without explicit differentiation, leading to reduced transparency, limited auditability, and difficulties in ex post reconstruction. This paper introduces the concept of nomology as a formal ordering framework for the structured description of collective decision processes. Nomology is defined as a system of explicitly specified categories, relations, and mechanisms that operate on a structural level prior to the application of concrete decision procedures or normative evaluations. Rather than prescribing outcomes or optimizing decisions, the proposed framework aims to make the roles, transitions, and dependencies within decision processes explicit and formally traceable. The paper delineates the core elements of a nomological framework, including fundamental contribution types, relational structures, and processual transitions, and clarifies its distinction from ontologies, explanatory theories, and normative programs. Furthermore, the relationship between nomology and existing approaches in science theory, social systems theory, computational social science, and explainable artificial intelligence is discussed. By providing a theory-agnostic and procedure-independent structural layer, nomology enables the systematic comparison, documentation, and auditability of collective decision processes across domains. The framework is proposed as an open research approach with potential applications in governance, organizational analysis, and the design of accountable socio-technical systems.",
          "This paper presents a functional prototype for an interactive web-based interface i_sift developed to foreground the decision-making process of an algorithm that detects similarities in legal texts through word embeddings. Using this as a case study in computational social science, our goal is, first, to highlight the importance of making computational tools and methods transparent to social scientists. Secondly, we suggest an approach that accomplishes this using methods and principles from interactive machine learning and the algorithmic experience framework.",
          "Understanding influencers’ perspectives and predicting public sentiment are crucial for event assessment and guidance in computational social systems, enabling more informed decision-making. However, this task is inherently challenging due to the unstructured, context-sensitive, and heterogeneous nature of online communication. To address these challenges, we propose a novel intelligent computational framework, Multi-domain Opinion Leader Agents Emotion Prediction (MOAEP). Our framework comprises three key components: (1) An Automatic Question Generation (AQG) module employing “Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How” (5W1H) questioning to systematically explore topic dimensions; (2) A Multi-domain Opinion Leader Agents (MOA) module that integrates enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce domain-specific responses; and (3) An emotion prediction engine that synthesizes agent interactions to forecast collective emotional responses, enabling proactive social computing analysis that surpasses conventional post-event methods. Experimental results demonstrate the framework’s efficacy: the AQG module generates high-fidelity outputs, while the influencer agents maintain consistent performance, achieving an average “Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4” (GPT-4) evaluation score of 6.85 (on a 0–10 scale) across multiple dimensions. In a social media conflict case study, “Russia-Ukraine War”, our framework successfully predicts key influencers’ perspectives and aligns emotional forecasts with observed real-world sentiment trends. These findings underscore the potential of MOAEP to provide actionable insights for decision-making in computational social science.",
          "The exponential growth of “Big Data” has given rise to a field known as computational social science (CSS). The authors view CSS as the interdisciplinary investigation of society that takes advantage of the massive amount of data generated by individuals in a way that allows for abductive research designs. Moreover, CSS complicates the relationship between data and theory by opening the door for a more data-driven approach to social science. This chapter will demonstrate the utility of a CSS approach using examples from dynamic interaction modeling, machine learning, and network analysis to investigate organizational communication (OC). The chapter concludes by suggesting that lessons learned from OC's history can help deal with addressing several current issues related to CSS, including an audit culture, data collection ethics, transparency, and Big Data hubris.",
          "Current trends in computational social sciences and data-driven research require access to reliable data sources. Data repositories fulfil this role, providing high-quality data services, since they satisfy certain requirements that can be briefly summarized as complying with the FAIR data principles. In this context, we outline the measures undertaken by SoDaNet to enhance the data repositories within our infrastructure. Through the adoption and implementation of the Dataverse software, along with a series of adaptations and customizations, we have improved the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of the data hosted in these repositories. This effort has resulted in data repositories responding effectively to the demands of the research community, improving the user experience both nationally and internationally.",
          "How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.",

Opportunities presented by big data and CSS to help extend existing theories and build new communication theories are discussed.",
          "The early Internet witnessed the flourishing of a digitally networked public sphere in which many people, including dissidents who had little to no access to mass media, found a voice as well as a place to connect with one another. As the Internet matures, its initial decentralized form has been increasingly replaced by a small number of ad-financed platforms, such as Facebook and Google, which structure the online experience of billions of people. These platforms often design, control, influence, and “optimize” the user experience according to their own internal values and priorities, sometimes using emergent methods such as algorithmic filtering and computational inference of private traits from computational social science. The shift to a small number of controlling platforms stems from a variety of dynamics, including network effects and the attractions of easier-to-use, closed platforms. This article considers these developments and their consequences for the vitality of the public sphere.",
          "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the role of mathematics in the humanities and social sciences, highlighting its growing importance in understanding complex human, social, and cultural phenomena. With the emergence of computational humanities and computational social sciences, mathematical methods such as statistical modelling, network analysis, game theory, and formal simulations have become integral to interdisciplinary research. The study examines core quantitative and computational approaches used across disciplines including economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, history, archaeology, and digital humanities. It further explores advanced mathematical frameworks such as topological data analysis, information theory, differential equations, and Fourier analysis, demonstrating their applicability in analysing social dynamics, cultural patterns, communication systems, and historical processes. While emphasizing the strengths of mathematical precision, scalability, and predictive capability, the paper also critically discusses challenges related to data complexity, model assumptions, and the distinction between correlation and causation. The study concludes that mathematics does not replace qualitative and interpretive traditions but powerfully complements them, enabling richer, data-driven insights into human behaviour and social structures. The interdisciplinary integration of mathematics is thus positioned as a transformative force shaping the future of humanities and social science research.",

          "Modeling real-world scenarios is a challenge for traditional social science researchers, as it is often hard to capture the intricacies and dynamisms of real-world situations without making simplistic assumptions. This imposes severe limitations on the capabilities of such models and frameworks. Complex population dynamics during natural disasters such as pandemics is an area where computational social science can provide useful insights and explanations. In this paper, we employ a novel intent-driven modeling paradigm for such real-world scenarios by causally mapping beliefs, goals, and actions of individuals and groups to overall behavior using a probabilistic representation called Bayesian Knowledge Bases (BKBs). To validate our framework we examine emergent behavior occurring near a national border during pandemics, specifically the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. The novelty of the work in this paper lies in representing the dynamism at multiple scales by including both coarse-grained (events at the national level) and finegrained (events at two separate border locations) information. This is especially useful for analysts in disaster management and first responder organizations who need to be able to understand both macro-level behavior and changes in the immediate vicinity, to help with planning, prevention, and mitigation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework in uncovering previously hidden connections and explanations by comparing independent models of the border locations with their fused model to identify emergent behaviors not found in either independent location models nor in a simple linear combination of those models.",

First, generative AI can significantly enhance the productivity of social scientists by automating the generation, annotation, and debugging of code. Second, it empowers researchers to delve into sophisticated data analysis through the innovative use of prompt engineering. Last, the educational sphere of CSS stands to benefit immensely from these tools, given their exceptional ability to annotate and elucidate complex codes for learners, thereby simplifying the learning process and making the technology more accessible.",

This type of research has allowed the collection of detailed information on large populations, thereby effectively challenging the distinction between qualitative and quantitative methods. Lately, access to this source of data has been significantly reduced after a series of scandals connected to the use of personal information collected through online platforms. The closure of APIs, however, can have positive effects, if it encourages researchers to reduce their dependence on mainstream platforms and explore new sources and ways to collect records on online interactions that are closer to the digital fieldwork.",
          "The digital revolution has led to the digitization of human behavior, creating unprecedented opportunities to understand observable actions on an unmatched scale. Emerging phenomena such as crowdfunding and crowdsourcing have further illuminated consumer behavior while also introducing new behavioral patterns. However, the sheer volume and complexity of this data present significant challenges for marketing researchers and practitioners. Traditional methods used to analyze consumer data fall short in handling the breadth, precision, and scale of emerging data sources. To address this, computational methods have been developed to manage the \"big data\" associated with consumer behavior, which typically includes structured data, textual data, audial data, and visual data. These methods, particularly machine learning, allow for effective parsing and processing of multi-faceted data. Given these recent developments, this review article seeks to familiarize researchers and practitioners with new data sources and analysis techniques for studying consumer behavior at scale. It serves as an introduction to the application of computational social science in understanding and leveraging publicly available consumer data.",

Spanning from Discord's launch in 2015 to the end of 2024, it offers a robust temporal and thematic framework for analyzing decentralized moderation, community governance, information dissemination, and social dynamics. Data was collected through Discord's public API, adhering to ethical guidelines and privacy standards via anonymization techniques. Organized into structured JSON files, the dataset facilitates seamless integration with computational social science methodologies. Preliminary analyses reveal significant trends in user engagement, bot utilization, and linguistic diversity, with English predominating alongside substantial representations of Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Additionally, prevalent community themes such as social, art, music, and memes highlight Discord's expansion beyond its gaming origins.",
          "Abstract Existing work on visualizing multivariate graphs is primarily concerned with representing the attributes of nodes. Even though edges are the constitutive elements of networks, there have been only few attempts to visualize attributes of edges. In this work, we focus on the critical importance of edge attributes for interpreting network visualizations and building trust in the underlying data. We propose ‘unfolding of edges’ as an interactive approach to integrate multivariate edge attributes dynamically into existing node‐link diagrams. Unfolding edges is an in‐situ approach that gradually transforms basic links into detailed representations of the associated edge attributes. This approach extends focus+context, semantic zoom, and animated transitions for network visualizations to accommodate edge details on‐demand without cluttering the overall graph layout. We explore the design space for the unfolding of edges, which covers aspects of making space for the unfolding, of actually representing the edge context, and of navigating between edges. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present two case studies in the context of historical network analysis and computational social science. For these, web‐based prototypes were implemented based on which we conducted interviews with domain experts. The experts' feedback suggests that the proposed unfolding of edges is a useful tool for exploring rich edge information of multivariate graphs.",
          "To what extent can data science methods â€“ such as machine learning, text analysis, or sentiment analysis â€“ push the research frontier in the social sciences? This chapter briefly describes the most prominent data science techniques that lend themselves to analyses of institutional and organizational governance structures. The authors elaborate on several examples applying data science to analyze legal, political, and social institutions and sketch how specific data science techniques can be used to study important research questions that could not (to the same extent) be studied without these techniques. They conclude by comparing the main strengths and limitations of computational social science with traditional empirical research methods and its relation to theory.",
          "Objective: This study aims to leverage an interdisciplinary computational social science perspective to quantitatively analyze the academic influence of scholars in China’s Sports Training Science field. By integrating Altmetrics indicators and citation metrics through a multidimensional evaluation model, it assesses scholars’ academic impact. Methods: Data for 16 indicators from the top 20 most productive scholars in Sports Training Science were collected from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce data dimensionality, extracting four common factors to generate a scoring coefficient matrix. A comprehensive evaluation score for scholarly influence was calculated, enabling a PCA-based ranking of these 20 scholars. Results: The five most influential scholars in this field are Tian Maijiu, Chen Peijie, Yang Guoqing, Zhang Liwei, and Cao Jianmin. Collectively, their work has advanced the refinement of China’s Sports Training Science system, deepened practical guidance, and elevated its international influence. Conclusion: The integration of Altmetrics and citation metrics successfully quantifies and identifies the core scholar group leading the development of China’s Sports Training Science. This study offers a more comprehensive perspective for evaluating scholarly influence and provides quantitative references for the management, development, and talent cultivation in Sports Training Science.",
          "The Russo-Ukrainian war and the deterioration of the relationship between Russia and the West made the application of traditional social science research methods, such as surveys and field work, difficult for researchers. It is likely that in the foreseeable future students of Russia will have to increasingly rely on the data that can be collected online. Using these data has defined the field of computational social science and has many analytical advantages. This paper provides a review of the sources of digital trace data for Russia and of the studies that used them for the analysis of political communication and behaviour, education, labour markets, discrimination, and the Russo-Ukrainian war.",

          "This study examines the phenomenon of TikTok refugees migrating to Xiaohongshu (RedNote) as a novel, affectively-driven form of digital cross-cultural adaptation. Moving beyond functionalist explanations for platform switching, we argue that this migration is primarily motivated by emotional responses to geopolitical pressures. Using amixed-methods approach that integrates computational social science techniquesincluding MDCOR (Machine Driven Classification of Open-ended Responses) for thematic analysis and SENA (Sentiment and Emotion Network Analysis) for emotion detectionwith qualitative interpretation, we analyse user discussions drawn from YouTube commentary concerning this migration. Results show that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, frustration) regarding the potential TikTok ban were the main drivers for migration (H1 supported). Afterwards, migrants demonstrated a significant increase in positive emotions (e.g., joy, belonging) on Xiaohongshu, indicating successful affective adaptation (H2 supported). Discourse analysis highlighted a predominant preference for Berrys integration strategy in acculturation, where users retain their original digital cultural identity while actively engaging with Xiaohongshus community (H3 supported). A positive correlation was also identified between users' emotional attitudes towards migration and their level of cultural engagement on the new platform (H4 supported). By combining computational social science with cross-cultural adaptation theory, this study emphasises the crucial role of affective factors in shaping digital migration and grassroots community formation within global social media ecosystems.",
          "Visual Knowledge Discovery (VKD), the emerging research field exploring the integration between Artificial Intelligence and Visual Analytics is impacting a growing number of contexts. This paper dwells on the potential intersections between the VKD perspective and the legal world, a scenario for many reasons drawn by the idea of combining empirical insights offered by computation with intuitive, visually-enhanced forms of data mining. We will focus on criminal justice, taking the cue from an ongoing experimental research project that investigates novel applications of computational social science methods - complex network analysis - to analyze criminal organizations for both scientific and investigative purposes. The work will describe the VKD solutions devised to allow public prosecutors to visually browse the content of phone calls and environmental tapping gathered during preliminary inquiries. We will discuss how given visualizations - graph-based visualizations in the first place - can enhance text mining techniques helping to capture in-a-glance communication flows, discussions' topics and both structural and functional features of criminal networks at hand.",
          "Abstract In the last decade, instigated by the Paris agreement and United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP22 and COP23), the efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels are expanding. The required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply a massive decarbonization worldwide with much involvement of regions, cities, businesses, and individuals in addition to the commitments at the national levels. Improving end-use efficiency is emphasized in previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2014). Serving as the primary ‘agents of change’ in the transformative process towards green economies, households have a key role in global emission reduction. Individual actions, especially when amplified through social dynamics, shape green energy demand and affect investments in new energy technologies that collectively can curb regional and national emissions. However, most energy-economics models—usually based on equilibrium and optimization assumptions—have a very limited representation of household heterogeneity and treat households as purely rational economic actors. This paper illustrates how computational social science models can complement traditional models by addressing this limitation. We demonstrate the usefulness of behaviorally rich agent-based computational models by simulating various behavioral and climate scenarios for residential electricity demand and compare them with the business as usual (SSP2) scenario. Our results show that residential energy demand is strongly linked to personal and social norms. Empirical evidence from surveys reveals that social norms have an essential role in shaping personal norms. When assessing the cumulative impacts of these behavioral processes, we quantify individual and combined effects of social dynamics and of carbon pricing on individual energy efficiency and on the aggregated regional energy demand and emissions. The intensity of social interactions and learning plays an equally important role for the uptake of green technologies as economic considerations, and therefore in addition to carbon-price policies (top-down approach), implementing policies on education, social and cultural practices can significantly reduce residential carbon emissions.",
          "Fifteen years ago, as an undergraduate computer science student in the United Kingdom, I read a popular science article (Matthews, 1999) profiling the research of my now colleague, Duncan Watts. This article, about the science of small-world networks, changed my life. To understand why, however, it is necessary to know that in the United Kingdom, there is (or at least was during the 1980s and 1990s) a profound \"them-versus-us\" split between the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields and all other disciplines. This split is amplified or perhaps even caused by the fact that people specialize at a very young age, choosing at 15 or 16 whether they will ever take another math course or write another essay again. I, like everyone else in my degree program, had chosen STEM, but my decision had not been easy – I had also wanted to study the social sciences. The article about Duncan's research changed my life because it had never before occurred to me that math and computers could be used to study social phenomena. For the first time, I realized that, rather than studying either computer science or the social sciences, perhaps I could study both. This, then, became my motivating goal.",

          "Timestamps in digital traces include significant detailed information on when human behaviors occur, which is universally available and standardized in all types of digital traces. Nevertheless, the concept of time is under-explicated in empirical studies of online behaviors. This paper discusses the (un)desirable properties of timestamps in digital traces and summarizes how timestamps in digital traces have been utilized in existing studies of online behaviors. The paper argues that time-in-behaviors perspective can provide a microscope with a renovated temporal lens to observe and understand online behaviors. Going beyond the traditional behaviors-in-time perspective, time-in-behaviors perspective enables empirical examination of online behaviors from multiple units of analysis (e.g., discrete behaviors, behavioral sessions, and behavioral trajectories) and from multiple dimensions (e.g., duration, order, transition, rhythm). The paper shows the potentials of the time-in-behaviors perspective with several empirical cases and proposes future directions in explicating the concept of time in computational social science.",
          "Current state-of-the-art in big social data analytics is largely limited to graph theoretical approaches such as social network analysis (SNA) informed by the social philosophical approach of relational sociology. This paper proposes and illustrates an alternate holistic approach to big social data analytics, social set analysis (SSA), which is based on the sociology of associations, mathematics of set theory, and advanced visual analytics of event studies. We illustrate our new approach by applying it to relate real-world events with their reflections in terms of user interactions on social media platforms. We present and discuss a theoretical and conceptual model of social data followed by a formal description of our technique based on set theory and event studies with a real-world social data example from Facebook. We then illustrate our new approach by reporting on the design, development, and evaluation results of a state-of-the-art visual analytics dashboard, the Social Set Visualizer (SoSeVi). Using SoSeVi, we conducted a real-world case study that consists of approximately 90 million Facebook user interactions from 11 different companies that have been mentioned in the traditional media in relation to the garment factory accidents in Bangladesh, and analyze the results. The enterprise application domain for the dashboard is corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the targeted end-users are CSR researchers and practitioners. The design of the dashboard was based on the social set analysis approach to computational social science mentioned above. The development of the dashboard involved cutting-edge open source visual analytics libraries (D3.js) and creation of new visualizations such as of actor mobility across time and space, conversational comets, and more. Evaluation of the dashboard consisted of technical testing, usability testing, and domain-specific testing with CSR students and yielded positive results. In conclusion, we discuss the new analytical- approach of social set analysis and conclude with a discussion of the benefits of set theoretical approaches based on the social philosophical approach of associational sociology.",

          "Among all Asian countries, Taiwan is probably the first one to have her own prediction markets. From the early 2000s to the mid-2000s, three prediction markets were established one after the other in Taiwan. This happened a few years before the first political prediction market in Japan, General Election Hatena, which was established in 2005 by Hatena Co.,1 and the first prediction market in New Zealand, ipredict, which was established in 2008 by Victoria University of Wellington and the New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation (ISCR).2 In this section, we shall give a brief introduction to the Taiwan prediction markets, their history, operation, research and publications. The Taiwan Political Exchange (TAIPEX) was established in 2003 at the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica in Taipei. Since then it has functioned several times to predict many important political events, including both the US and Taiwan presidential elections in 2004 (Wang et al., 2004, 2006, 2009).3 The AI-ECON Futures Exchange (AI-ECON FX) was established in 2006 at the AIECON Research Center, National Chengchi University in Taipei.4 It was established in an attempt to integrate agent-based computational economics and experimental economics as an initial step to further overarch computational social sciences with experimental social sciences (Chen and Tai, 2006; Barr et al., 2008). This project was sponsored by the National Science Council for three years from the middle of 2006 to the middle of 2009. AI-ECON FX has been applied to predict the opening day of the high speed railway in Taiwan. In November 2006 both TAIPEX and AI-ECON FX were run in parallel to predict the Taipei and Kaohsiung City mayoral elections (Chen and Wu, 2009).5",

          "The rise of new technologies and platforms, such as mobile devices and streaming services, has substantially changed the media entertainment landscape and continues to do so. Since its subject of study is changing constantly and rapidly, research on media entertainment has to be quick to adapt. This need to quickly react and adapt not only relates to the questions researchers need to ask but also to the methods they need to employ to answer those questions. Over the last few years, the field of computational social science has been developing and using methods for the collection and analysis of data that can be used to study the use, content, and effects of entertainment media. These methods provide ample opportunities for this area of research and can help in overcoming some of the limitations of self-report data and manual content analyses that most of the research on media entertainment is based on. However, they also have their own set of challenges that researchers need to be aware of and address to make (full) use of them. This thematic issue brings together studies employing computational methods to investigate different types and facets of media entertainment. These studies cover a wide range of entertainment media, data types, and analysis methods, and clearly highlight the potential of computational approaches to media entertainment research. At the same time, the articles also include a critical perspective, openly discuss the challenges and limitations of computational methods, and provide useful suggestions for moving this nascent field forward.",
          "The explosion of social digital data and the concomitant increases in computational capabilities along the data analytics pipeline (data acquisition, storage and analysis) impact upon the possibilities and choices for conducting social research. This report examines the emerging research field called computational social science (CSS). The aim of this review is to offer insight into the shape of CSS, its questions and methodologies, and how these relate to and interact with different social science disciplines. Two searches and hand sorting identified 41 of the most highly cited publications. The papers were initially categorised into two main groups of papers: substantive-technical contributions and critical-review contributions. The groups were thematically analysed. As a validation and refinement exercise, a further search identified thirty of the most recent CSS papers, which were also categorised and analysed. The review focuses on the first 41 articles as well as several other relevant articles are discussed that were identified through citations, additional ad hoc searches, and personal conversations. The substantive-technical literature and critical-review literature can each be sub-divided into three groups, and findings from these six groups are described. In the discussion, we draw out points related to interdisciplinarity and potential implications of the findings for engagement research communities.",

Furthermore, its development takes also advantage of the availability of innovative modeling tools, of the increasing computing power of computers, and of everyday larger and detailed datasets about social phenomena. The chapter thus describes concepts derived from the fields of complexity, social mechanisms, and social networks. Then it focuses on the methods used in computational social science and particularly on the predominant role played by agent-based modeling, network analysis, and social simulation in general. The chapter proceeds with an introduction to the general and common characteristics of the software tools available for conducting causality research in computational social science. The chapter concludes with a short discussion of some important practical critical issues related to the computational social science approach to explain social phenomena (uncertainty, model communication).",
          "The ongoing war in Ukraine has generated unprecedented volumes of digital data across multiple domains, from weapons effectiveness and battlefield casualties to military communications and economic impacts. This digitalization of warfare has created new opportunities for computational social science research, paralleling the broader trend of increasing digital traces in human activities. Our study focuses on the communications and subsequent reactions within Russian military bloggers' (``milbloggers'') Telegram channels, specifically examining their war-related content in the original Russian langiage. These communications have emerged as a crucial component of the Russian information sphere, potentially influencing war policy and political decision-making. Telegram's perceived security features, including robust encryption and privacy protocols, have made it a preferred platform for such discourse. The Russian leadership has strategically utilized milbloggers' posts and their audience reactions as both a barometer of public sentiment and a tool for shaping public opinion regarding the conflict's developments. While quantifying the effectiveness of these influence operations remains challenging due to data limitations, our analysis concentrates on the observable ``input'' - the milbloggers' posts and their associated reactions. This dataset provides valuable insights into the ongoing conflict and serves as a foundation for modeling public opinion dynamics and sentiment evolution in digital warfare contexts.",
          "Abstract In this paper, we situate our computational approach to philosophy relative to other digital humanities and computational social science practices, based on reflections stemming from our research on the PolyGraphs project in social epistemology. We begin by describing PolyGraphs. An interdisciplinary project funded by the Academies (BA, RS, and RAEng) and the Leverhulme Trust, it uses philosophical simulations (Mayo-Wilson and Zollman, 2021) to study how ignorance prevails in networks of inquiring rational agents. We deploy models developed in economics (Bala and Goyal, 1998), and refined in philosophy (O’Connor and Weatherall, 2018; Zollman, 2007), to simulate communities of agents engaged in inquiry, who generate evidence relevant to the topic of their investigation and share it with their neighbors, updating their beliefs on the evidence available to them. We report some novel results surrounding the prevalence of ignorance in such networks. In the second part of the paper, we compare our own to other related academic practices. We begin by noting that, in digital humanities projects of certain types, the computational component does not appear to directly support the humanities research itself; rather, the digital and the humanities are simply grafted together, not fully intertwined and integrated. PolyGraphs is notably different: the computational work directly supports the investigation of the primary research questions, which themselves belong decidedly within the humanities in general, and philosophy in particular. This suggests an affinity with certain projects in the computational social sciences. But despite these real similarities, there are differences once again: the computational philosophy we practice aims not so much at description and prediction as at answering the normative and interpretive questions that are distinctive of humanities research.",
          "Ipseology is the study of human identity using large datasets and computational social science methods. It is a new way to investigate ipseity at scale. Ipseity refers to selfhood, individuality and the essential elements of identity. At scale means with millions of observations covering substantial temporal periods and geographical areas. One measures ipseity with language. Specifically, the data sought is personally expressed identity text. This text must satisfy all three conditions. It should be personal - the authors are describing themselves. It should be expressed - the authors' text is \"published,\" i.e. the words are available where others might see them. It should describe identity - the explicit purpose of the text is description of the author. Ipseology reduces complexity by focusing on signifiers. Signifiers are linguistic tokens that represent something the author wishes to convey about their identity.",
          "We propose a complex systems approach to the study of political belief systems, to overcome some of the fragmentation in the current scholarship on ideology. We review relevant work in psychology, sociology, and political science and identify major cleavages in the literature: the spatial vs. non-spatial divide (ideologies as reducible to a spatially organized set of dimensions vs. as complex conceptual structures) and the person-group problem (ideologies as driven by psychological needs of individuals vs. by institutional and power structures of society). We argue that construing ideologies as conceptual networks of cognitive-affective representations embedded in social networks of people may provide a path for bridging these existing gaps and epistemological disputes. Tools from cognitive science and computational social science such as cognitive-affective mapping, connectionist simulations, and agent-based modeling are appropriate methods for a new research program that substantiates our complex systems perspective on ideology.",

          "Abstract Objective The goals of the study were to examine therapists' and clients' emotional states and expressions in an emotionally focused therapy (EFT) couple session, to assess therapeutic attunement between the clients and the therapist, and to explore its alignment with EFT techniques. Background Therapeutic attunement is crucial for fostering a therapeutic alliance in couples therapy, yet examining triadic relationships between therapist and partners is methodologically challenging. This case study introduces a novel computational social science approach to capture attunement in an EFT session. Method A full‐length, publicly available EFT session video was analyzed. We generated text, audio, and image data for computerized tracking and conducted a multimodal analysis of emotions using mixture of experts machine learning models. Results Seven emotion states were analyzed: anger, fear, surprise, disgust, joy, sadness, and neutral. The results indicated a close alignment between the couple and the therapist's emotions, suggesting high attunement. Three types of attunement by timing were identified: on time, therapist initiated, and delayed. Attunement peaks aligned with EFT techniques. Conclusion High levels of therapeutic attunement, facilitated by EFT techniques, can be effectively captured and analyzed using machine learning. Implications This study highlights the feasibility of using machine learning to track attunement dynamics and aids therapists in exploring therapeutic ruptures.",
          "The gaming industry plays a crucial role in the realm of entertainment within our society. However, from Monopoly to Flight Simulators, serious games have also been appealing tools for learning a new language, conveying values, or training skills.

This integration is of particular interest due to the vast amount of data that can be collected through a game, which is needed to feed the AI algorithms. This paper aims to identify relevant research paths in the intersection of serious games, AI, and computational social science, particularly in their utilization as novel research tools to comprehend human behavior and society. To provide a comprehensive context, we also present an overview of the serious game research field identifying the most prominent application areas and analyzing applications of AI in serious games that hold great potential for computational social science research. The goal of our work is to establish a valuable framework for researchers interested in utilizing serious games as a novel tool for AI-supported social research.",
          "READ ME Simulating Human Responses to Environmental Messaging Dr Ian Drumm and Dr Atefeh Tate This dataset will be referenced from a corresponsing article in the Journal of Computational Social Science. The data presented pertains to ongoing work to implement and evaluate virtual humans whose responses to environmental messaging are shaped by their media diets and social interactions. The project scraped thousands of social media post–comment pairs related to environmental issues, classified them by viewpoint through the large-scale orchestration of multiple instances of large language models, and built a vector database of embedded interactions with associated classification metadata to serve as a knowledge source for a chatbot. Dynamic, metadata-based filtering of this knowledge source, in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation, enabled a chatbot with selectable personas that generate responses to new social media posts based on stereotypical attitudes grounded in current news and zeitgeists. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation was conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach, though its full potential remains to be explored. Data Content & Compliance Note Original Content Redaction: Due to strict Data Redistribution restrictions in Reddit's Terms of Service and API policies, the original user-generated content (posts and comments) used to generate this dataset has been entirely redacted. Data Provided: To enable analysis and evaluation of the metric scoring system, the dataset includes synthetic or \"fake\" comments and all associated quantitative and qualitative metrics (e.g., BERT scores, perplexity, and category justifications). This allows for the verification of scoring algorithms without violating the original content license. Source Code https://github.com/iduos/CLIMATE_BOT Code for generating database of classified comments is given via the github.

For a given post a real comment and a generated comment were compared. The real comment’s id was used to filter it from RAG context. Hence, we ensured each real comment during the evaluation wasn’t included in formulating the chatbot’s generated comment. The generated comment was added to a new dataset of items of the form {post/real comment/chatbot comment}. The {real comment / chatbot comment} pairs were presented as respective reference and generated texts to a variety of tools for calculating chatbot metrics. Hence, averages were determined. We wanted to demonstrate linguistic similarity performance, semantic alignment, language predictability and emotional alignment. Our automated evaluation used the following quantitative metrics ...

          "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in a few decades, have outperformed the existing state of the art methods in classification context. However, in the way they were formalised, CNNs are bound to operate on euclidean spaces. Indeed, convolution is a signal operation that are defined on euclidean spaces. This has restricted deep learning main use to euclidean-defined data such as sound or image. And yet, numerous computer application fields (among which network analysis, computational social science, chemo-informatics or computer graphics) induce non-euclideanly defined data such as graphs, networks or manifolds. In this paper we propose a new convolution neural network architecture, defined directly into graph space. Convolution and pooling operators are defined in graph domain. We show its usability in a back-propagation context. Experimental results show that our model performance is at state of the art level on simple tasks. It shows robustness with respect to graph domain changes and improvement with respect to other euclidean and non-euclidean convolutional architectures.",

          "Leading theories on parenting in the United States suggest that parenting styles vary widely by socioeconomic status, with middle-class parents practicing \"concerted cultivation\"—marked by parents’ intensive efforts to foster their children’s development—and working-class parents engaging in the \"accomplishment of natural growth\"—with children given more freedom to manage their own time. While it is frequently inferred that these parenting practices reflect different cultural logics of parenting, such logics are inherently hard to measure. Our paper proposes a new way to study parenting logics using computational social science (CSS) techniques applied to a nationally representative survey where respondents provided parenting advice across three hypo- thetical parenting situations. We analyze this advice using Biterm Topic Modeling and explore whether the resulting topics vary by respondents’ race/ethnicity, education, and income. We find that nearly all parenting logics reflect some form of intensive parenting but, within that, multiple nuanced versions of parenting emerge, varying across two dimensions: (1) assertive vs negotiated parenting, and (2) pedagogic vs pragmatic parenting. Using fractional multinomial logistic regression, we find little difference in how parenting logics vary by race/ethnicity, education, and income, revealing much more similarity across socioeconomic and sociodemographic groups than commonly understood. These findings demonstrate how CSS provides new tools to enrich the study of long-standing questions in social science research and complement the use of more \"traditional\" research methods in a synergistic manner.",
          "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has been increasingly integrated into painting, video, and interactive installation art. At the same time, empirical studies have shown that humans are biased against AI Art. However, the reasons behind this bias need to be further explored. This study collects public comment data from Weibo to examine the Chinese public's attention to AI art and the reasons for differing attitudes, based on comment content, time, and gender. Using computational social science methods, the study analyzes discussions on \"AI art\" through LDA topic model and sentiment analysis. The results show that the Chinese public holds slightly more negative than positive attitudes toward AI Art, primarily due to concerns over original copyright issues, homogenization of style, lack of emotion, career replacement anxiety, and the lack of artistic aura.",

          "There is strong agreement that generative AI should be regulated, but strong disagreement on how to approach regulation. While some argue that AI regulation should mostly rely on extensions of existing laws, others argue that entirely new laws and regulations are needed to ensure that generative AI benefits society. In this paper, I argue that the debates on generative AI regulation can be informed by the debates and evidence on social media regulation. For example, AI companies have faced allegations of political bias regarding the images and text their models produce, similar to the allegations social media companies have faced regarding content ranking on their platforms. First, I compare and contrast the affordances of generative AI and social media to highlight their similarities and differences. Then, I discuss specific policy recommendations based on the evolution of social media and their regulation. These recommendations include investments in: efforts to counter bias and perceptions thereof (e.g., via transparency, researcher access, oversight boards, democratic input, research studies), specific areas of regulatory concern (e.g., youth wellbeing, election integrity) and trust and safety, computational social science research, and a more global perspective. Applying lessons learnt from social media regulation to generative AI regulation can save effort and time, and prevent avoidable mistakes.",

          "Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

          "This study analyzes Türkiye's political landscape by harnessing Computational Social Science techniques to parse extensive data about public ideologies from the Project_Name database. Unlike existing theoretical frameworks that focus on the ideologies of political elites and cadres, this study examines public ideologies in a contentious political manner. Exploiting an AI-based data generation pipeline on digital traces, it distills the eight most prevalent ideologies down to the city level and employs exploratory statistical analyses. Principal Component Analysis delineates two fundamental axes: the traditional left-right political spectrum and a separate spectrum of secular-religious inclination, encompassing both political and cultural dimensions. Then, the Cluster Analysis reveals three distinct groups: left-leaning and religiously inclined, centre-right-leaning and religiously inclined, and those with a centre-right-leaning focus and a pronounced secular orientation. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the political and cultural axes within political society, offering a clearer understanding of the most recent ideological and political climate in Türkiye.",

Because research-based literature is still inconclusive in this regard, the authors exploited scientific-citations and co-citation data to study the development of computational social science's intellectual structure. The findings suggest that network science has maintained centrality over the years. Contrary to common perceptions however, the field has not become more integrated over time. Rather, the network of co-citation among the field's key authors exhibits ever more extensive clustering and greater average path length over 2000-2020, indicating that the discipline is fracturing into various sub-communities, with loose connections to each other.",
          "An iterative process of social science theory improvement through computational social science includes theory, computation, and then readjustment of theory. The key to iterative improvement is the ability to make use of the partially correct enough to improve upon it. The techniques of soft computation can help us to make full use of partially correct and inconsistent data. Probabilistic ontologies serve to repurpose data for use by drawing probabilistic correspondence. Probability theory can accommodate all types of uncertainty, from credibility in the theories or the data, to intrinsic uncertainty, to uncertainty of match. Probabilistic ontologies can process this data, whether the processing involves Bayesian data generation, the computation of a scalar value of match for validation, the representation of dynamic in a Markov Process, or expressing the data with gradient so that data mining may be used to help readjust theory. 1. Improving Social Theory through Computational Social Science The scientific method has helped us to accumulate knowledge about, navigate, and control the physical world through an iterative process of theory and statistical hypothesis testing. Scientific empirical methods tease out cause by holding all else the same but a single independent variable, to see if the results behave according to the theory. The computer has helped to make non-empirical advances in science, in the form of elaborate thought experiments, called simulations. Computational science is able to take the building blocks of consistent relations that were established during empirical experimentation and put them together, thinking out the complexities of interrelations between the parts that our minds are not capable of. Computational science is becoming more important than empirical science in physics and in chemistry, sciences in which our theories of fundamental relations are accurate. For example, simulation is the only way that nuclear testing is done anymore. However, computational science is not as trustworthy as empiricism in every science. In the hard sciences, computational science and simulation have predictive accuracy because the hard sciences are well understood. Computational social science, on the other hand, has less predictive accuracy because social science is less well understood. It is difficult to make controlled experiments where “all else is the same” in social sciences, and so it is difficult to tease out accurate fundamental relations. More importantly, the social world is a complex adaptive system in which the results come from complicated interactions that could not be teased out by keeping all else the same even if there were no moral considerations to prevent experimentation. Methodologies are needed to improve the scientific thought experiment of computer simulation, in order to improve theory, so that theoretical cause may be teased out through augmented observation and reasoning, despite the fact that it cannot be empirically manipulated. Our goal is to find ways to understand complex adaptive systems, in which many things cause each other through feedback, on the basis of observation as opposed to manipulation. Since social experiments cannot be adequately controlled for, we need the ability to understand social systems in the absence of as full a capacity to experiment as we have in the hard sciences. A science of society needs methodologies of gaining knowledge given many observations with inexact conditions as opposed to the few observations under exact conditions of physical science. Natural phenomena appear random to the extent that the phenomena are misunderstood, and sound theories direct us in ways to see the world so that patterns appear and sense is made out of the apparent randomness. With methodologies to improve social theories so that knowledge can accumulate, regularities could be understood and controlled in the social and economic world as they are in the physical world now. This paper proposes an iterative methodology for improving scientific theory by computer, so that the computer may be a mental prosthesis for the thought experiment, to help guide us to regularities and make sense of data from multiple perspectives. Our methodology emphasizes the repurposing of data: data that is observed from many different theories and perspectives because no theory or perspective about the social world has given us a satisfactory amount of control over our social policies, data that does not tease out truth in lower quantities, but helps us to approach truth in higher quantities. Our purpose is to suggest processes through which we may iteratively make sense of data and recognize when we are successful at it. One good thing about our situation is that we know what success looks like: the more accurate our theories are, the more they will reduce uncertainty in a general manner. An iterative process of theory improvement needs to make use of and improve upon that which is incorrect, inconsistent, and uncertain, and draw up structured correspondence to make sense of it. The techniques of soft computing provide the robustness needed, and the techniques of inference provide the structured correspondence. In the iterative process, first, simulation would compute out the implications of the assumptions in a simulation experiment (thought experiment). Then, we compare the result to results in the real world (validation), and finally, we adjust the categorization of the data and its relations so that the results more generally match the real world (theory discovery) , and start over again. Human in the loop is important in all stages of this process, especially in the discovery of new theoretical categorizations and relations stage. Our goal is to suggest ways to assist the decision-maker in all stages of this process as much as possible, even the discovery stage. 2. Uncertainty in Computational Social",

          "Social science data often comes in the form of high-dimensional discrete data such as categorical survey responses, social interaction records, or text. These data sets exhibit high degrees of sparsity, missingness, overdispersion, and burstiness, all of which present challenges to traditional statistical modeling techniques. The framework of Poisson factorization (PF) has emerged in recent years as a natural way to model high-dimensional discrete data sets. This framework assumes that each observed count in a data set is a Poisson random variable $y ~ Pois(\\mu)$ whose rate parameter $\\mu$ is a function of shared model parameters. This thesis examines a specific subset of Poisson factorization models that constrain $\\mu$ to be a multilinear function of shared model parameters. This subset of models---hereby referred to as allocative Poisson factorization (APF)---enjoys a significant computational advantage: posterior inference scales linearly with only the number of non-zero counts in the data set. A challenge to constructing and performing inference in APF models is that the multilinear constraint on $\\mu$---which must be non-negative, by the definition of the Poisson distribution---means that the shared model parameters must themselves be non-negative. Constructing models that capture the complex dependency structures inherent to social processes---e.g., networks with overlapping communities of actors or bursty temporal dynamics---without relying on the analytic convenience and tractability of the Gaussian distribution requires novel constructions of non-negative distributions---e.g., gamma and Dirichlet---and innovative posterior inference techniques. This thesis presents the APF analogue to several widely-used models---i.e., CP decomposition (Chapter 3), Tucker decomposition (Chapter 4), and linear dynamical systems (Chapters 5 and 6) and shows how to perform Bayesian inference in APF models under local differential privacy (Chapter 7). Most of these chapters introduce novel auxiliary-variable augmentation schemes to facilitate posterior inference using both Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms. While the task of modeling international relations event data is a recurrent theme, the models presented are applicable to a wide range of tasks in many fields.",

In this paper, we report our efforts in analyzing anti-American views on Twitter. We have collected over three years of Turkish tweets related to the US, translated them into English, and analyzed these tweets using various computational social science tools. We found that Turkish tweets related to the US are significantly negative, and emotions reflect disgust and anger. Furthermore, we found that the source of the negative views stems from political actors like Trump or Biden rather than general hatred.

          "Abstract Big data has increased attention to Computational Social Science (CSS) on the part of policymakers because it has the power to make populations, activities and behaviour visible in ways that were not previously possible. This kind of analysis, however, often has unforeseen implications for those who are the subjects of the research. This chapter asks what a social justice perspective can tell us about the potential, and the risks, of this kind of analysis when it is oriented towards informing policy. Who benefits, and how, when computational methods and new data sources are used to conduct policy-relevant analysis? Should CSS sidestep, through its novelty and its identification with computational and statistical methodologies, sidestep ethical review and the assessments of power asymmetries and methodological justification that are common in social science research? If not, how should these be applied to CSS research, and what kind of assessment is appropriate? The analysis offers two main conclusions: first, that the field of CSS has evolved without an accompanying evolution of debates on ethics and justice and that these debates are long overdue. Second, that CSS is privileged as policy-relevant research precisely because of many of the features which bring up concerns about justice—large-scale datasets, remote data gathering, purely quantitative methods and an orientation towards policy questions rather than the needs of the research subjects.",
          "ABSTRACT In the era of big and ubiquitous data, professionals and students alike are finding themselves needing to perform a number of textual analysis tasks. Historically, the general lack of statistical expertise and programming skills has stopped many with humanities or social sciences backgrounds from performing and fully benefiting from such analyses. Thus, we introduce Coconut Libtool ( www.coconut-libtool.com/ ), an open‐source, web‐based application that utilizes state‐of‐the‐art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Coconut Libtool analyzes text data from customized files and bibliographic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Lens. Users can verify which functions can be performed with the data they have. Coconut Libtool deploys multiple algorithmic NLP techniques at the backend, including topic modeling ( LDA, Biterm, and BERTopic algorithms), network graph visualization, keyword lemmatization, and sunburst visualization. Coconut Libtool is the people‐first web application designed to be used by professionals, researchers, and students in the information sciences, digital humanities, and computational social sciences domains to promote transparency, reproducibility, accessibility, reciprocity, and responsibility in research practices.",
          "Replication crises have shaken the scientific landscape during the last decade. As potential solutions, open science practices were heavily discussed and have been implemented with varying success in different disciplines. We argue that computational-x disciplines such as computational social science, are also susceptible for the symptoms of the crises, but in terms of reproducibility. We expand the binary definition of reproducibility into a tier system which allows increasing levels of reproducibility based on external verfiability to counteract the practice of open-washing. We provide solutions for barriers in Computational Social Science that hinder researchers from obtaining the highest level of reproducibility, including the use of alternate data sources and considering reproducibility proactively.",
          "Since its inception, computational social science (CSS) has been characterized as an interdisciplinary field. Nevertheless, unlike a mature interdisciplinary field that duly integrates knowledge beyond disciplinary boundaries, CSS has arguably been fragmented into multiple lines of inquiry. Although such fragmentation has been a constant concern, limited empirical evidence exists to substantiate any degree of integration in research on CSS. To systematically map the landscape of research on CSS, we examined the dynamic topology of the bibliometric network of CSS during the past 20 years. By comparing the structure of the coupling network and the co-subject network with three prototypical network models that we simulated—the centralized model, the fragmented model, and the cohesive model—our analysis revealed that the citation networks of research on CSS are highly centralized but less fragmented than often assumed. Beyond that, a driving factor shaping the coupling network’s cohesive structure is the citation to high-impact articles. Those and other findings contribute to current understandings of the process of integration in the evolution of disciplines.",
          "This monograph offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to the study of digital communities in the age of AI. It brings together methods from computational social science, statistics, and machine learning, showing how digital traces can be collected, interpreted, and contextualised without losing sight of ethical constraints or data limitations. The authors guide the reader through the practical challenges of working with online data – biases, platform constraints, and the “post-API era” – while providing a coherent framework for analysing collective behaviour. Techniques ranging from network analysis to distributional modelling, topic extraction, and large language models are presented with clarity, highlighting both their potential and their limitations. A distinctive contribution of the book is the integration of personality modelling with community structure and polarisation dynamics. By linking individual traits to collective patterns, the monograph illustrates how different analytical levels can be connected to understand why communities form, diverge, or radicalise. Accessible yet rigorous, this volume is suited for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners seeking both methodological grounding and practical guidance for studying digital behaviour. It serves as a bridge between established statistical approaches and emerging AI-based methods, encouraging critical, responsible, and reproducible research.",
          "This article reviews the development of computational models of creativity where social interactions are central. We refer to this area as computational social creativity. Its context is described, including the broader study of creativity, the computational modeling of other social phenomena, and computational models of individual creativity. Computational modeling has been applied to a number of areas of social creativity and has the potential to contribute to our understanding of creativity. A number of requirements for computational models of social creativity are common in artificial life and computational social science simulations. Three key themes are identified: (1) computational social creativity research has a critical role to play in understanding creativity as a social phenomenon and advancing computational creativity by making clear epistemological contributions in ways that would be challenging for other approaches; (2) the methodologies developed in artificial life and computational social science carry over directly to computational social creativity; and (3) the combination of computational social creativity with individual models of creativity presents significant opportunities and poses interesting challenges for the development of integrated models of creativity that have yet to be realized.",
          "API-based research is an approach to computational social sciences and digital sociology based on the extraction of records from the datasets made available by online platforms through their application programming interfaces (APIs). This type of research has allowed the collection of detailed information on large populations, thereby effectively challenging the distinction between qualitative and quantitative methods. Lately, access to this source of data has been significantly reduced after a series of scandals connected to the use of personal information.

          "Social networking Web sites are amassing vast quantities of data and computational social science is providing tools to process this data. The combination of these two factors has significant implications for individuals and society. With announcements of growing data aggregation by both Google and Facebook, the need for consideration of these issues is becoming urgent. Just as Web 2.0 platforms put publishing in the hands of the masses, without adequate safeguards, computational social science may make surveillance, profiling, and targeting overly accessible. The academic study of computational social science explains the field as an interdisciplinary investigation of the social dynamics of society with the aid of advanced computational systems. Such investigation can operate at the macro level of global attitudes and trends, down to the personal level of an individual’s psychology. This paper uses the lenses of computation social science to consider the uses and dangers that may result from the data aggregation social media companies are perusing. We also consider the role ethics and regulation may play in protecting the public.",
          "This thesis contributes to the growing field of Computational Social Science by using data from Facebook and Twitter to study: the differential usage of Facebook around the world; older people’s close friendships; immigrants’ language acquisition; and European regional family ties. The first study was a descriptive comparative analysis of the use of Facebook by older and young people worldwide. The second study showed how, in the European Union, the likelihood of having close friends differs between older people who use the internet and Facebook compared to older people who live offline. The third study used data from Twitter to analyze how civic integration and citizenship requirements in the EU-15 are associated with immigrants’ median times to start tweeting in the language of the host society. The final study focused on the European regional family ties distinction, hypothesizing on whether European North-South differences in family dynamics are reflected in Twitter users’ conversations as well.",

          "This chapter discusses the challenges and opportunities of incorporating computational social science (CSS) into political science. Using an original dataset of quantitative methods courses offered at the top-40 schools, this study shows that CSS courses are currently underrepresented, but their number is likely to augment because of the competition among schools. Yet, this trend is likely to stay confined to North American and Western European schools. Also, collaboration in CSS requires reconciling research priorities in engineering and physics (prediction) and in political science (explanation). Regarding research, big data does not mitigate concerns about causation and representativeness. But simulations allow studying rare phenomena and phenomena for which experiments are not appropriate. By running thousands of experiments at various combinations of explanatory variables, simulations explore counterfactuals, assess the explanatory power of competing theories, and make forecasts.",
          "This study explores the Iranian public’s perception of economic inflation, emphasizing the representation and subsequent attitudes across different commodity categories. Using data from X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram between October 2022 and November 2023, this study applies quantitative content and sentiment analyses on over 6.3 million posts, comparing social-media representation with official inflation data. Computational social science methods, such as data mining, facilitated the data collection. The results reveal a hierarchy of representation: capital commodities (housing, cars, and gold) receiving the most attention, followed by essential and lastly non-essential ones, with little to no consistent correlation between inflation rate and representation. A negative binomial regression confirms that inflation itself is not a significant predictor of public attention, while commodity type, particularly capital commodities, exerts a strong independent effect. Sentiment analysis shows that positive reactions to capital commodity inflation exceed those for essential by a factor of 5.1 and non-essential by 18. Therefore, the emphasis on capital commodities is not merely a response to living-cost crisis or perceptual bias, but reflects collective economic memory and experience under a rentier-crony capitalist system. In this Global South context, speculative behaviors towards capital commodities emerge as a socially-reinforced survival strategy to preserve wealth.",
          "When we have a population of individuals or artificially intelligent agents possessing diverse subjective inputs (e.g. predictions, opinions, etc.) about a common topic, how should we collect and combine them into a single judgment or estimate? This has long been a fundamental question across disciplines that concern themselves with forecasting and decision-making, and has attracted the attention of computer scientists particularly on account of the proliferation of online platforms for electronic commerce and the harnessing of collective intelligence. In this dissertation, I study this problem through the lens of computational social science in three main parts: (1) Incentives in information aggregation: In this segment, I analyze mechanisms for the elicitation and combination of private information from strategic participants, particularly crowdsourced forecasting tools called prediction markets. I show that (a) when a prediction market implemented with a widely used family of algorithms called market scoring rules (MSRs) interacts with myopic risk-averse traders, the price process behaves like an opinion pool, a classical family of belief combination rules, and (b) in an MSR-based game-theoretic model of prediction markets where participants can influence the predicted outcome but some of them have a non-zero probability of being non-strategic, the equilibrium is one of two types, depending on this probability -- either collusive and uninformative or partially revealing; (2) Aggregation with non-strategic agents: In this part, I am agnostic to incentive issues, and focus on algorithms that uncover the ground truth from a sequence of noisy versions. In particular, I present the design and analysis of an approximately Bayesian algorithm for learning a real-valued target given access only to censored Gaussian signals, that performs asymptotically almost as well as if we had uncensored signals; (3) Market\\nmaking in practice: This component, although tied to the two previous themes, deals more directly with practical aspects of aggregation mechanisms. Here, I develop an adaptation of an MSR to a nancial market setting called a continuous double auction, and document its\\nexperimental evaluation in a simulated market ecosystem.",
          "Abstract Computational social science can help advance climate policy and help solve the climate crises. To do so, several steps need to be overcome to make the best use of the wealth of data and variety of models available to evaluate climate change policies. Here, we review the state of the art of numerical modelling and data science methods applied to policy evaluation. We emphasize that significant progress has been made but that critical social and economic phenomena—especially related to climate justice—are not yet fully captured and thus limit the predictivity and usefulness of computational approaches. We posit that the integration of statistical and numerical approaches is key to developing a new impact evaluation science that overcomes the traditional divide between ex ante and ex post approaches.",

          "Because of its many uses, personality categorisation has attracted a lot of attention in the fields of psychology, computational social science, and machine learning (ML). In order to improve customer service experiences by matching clients with appropriate support workers, this article introduces PersoNet, a novel framework designed to determine personality types using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). PersoNet has an outstanding classification accuracy of over 93.98% and uses a CNN and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network architecture. The BiLSTM + CNN design successfully captures temporal correlations and semantic complexities in textual data, which contributes to this high degree of accuracy, according to our thorough studies using the MBTI dataset. According to our experimental data, PersoNet can thus precisely choose customer care representatives that fit the personalities of its clients, resulting in a Customer Satisfaction Rate (CSR) of over 97.82%—a noteworthy increase of 20.25% in CSR. These findings position PersoNet as a state-of-the-art personality categorisation tool that significantly improves customer service quality while outperforming current techniques in terms of accuracy and computational economy.",

This article provides a taxonomy of the full breadth of the Synthetic Data domain. We discuss its place in the research ecosystem by linking the advances in computational social science with the idea of the Fourth Paradigm of scientific discovery that integrates the elements of the evolution from empirical to theoretic to computational models. Further, leveraging the framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice, we discuss how evaluation criteria vary across use cases as the information is used to add value and draw insights.

          "Spatial Data Science Needs Explanations! (And Not Just Predictions) Mark Gahegan The University of Auckland, New Zealand (m.gahegan@auckland.ac.nz) Introduction Spatial Data Science facilitates new approaches to longstanding problems in health, policy, ecology and economy. But to make the most effective use of it, we need analytical methods that are straightforward to apply, open to review and audit, and produce results that can be correctly interpreted by practicing researchers and policymakers. Leveraging data science presents many challenges that manifest in unique ways in the geospatial realm, including: the nature of errors and bias in data, the opportunities afforded by new and dynamic data sources, the need for transparency and the ability to question assumptions where outcomes are used for public policy. The model-free nature of popular data science methods means they typically operate as black boxes. As such it is difficult to validate their outcomes in ways that stand up to policy debates and foster public trust. The capacity of data science to help us explain and understand the underlying causes for the patterns we find in data has lagged behind the development of new analytical methods (Shmueli, 2010). But better explanation and transparency are necessary to empower end-users to interpret outputs in ways that conceptually align with pre-existing knowledge (Doshi-Velez, and Kim, 2017; Lipton, 2016). From this perspective, there is currently an over-dependence on correlative models that neither represent process nor embed theory (O’Sullivan, 2018). The most capable predictive methods are typically opaque, with no explanation, and no error distributions that connect back to the underlying mechanisms that are driving outcomes. This limits the insights obtained, and our ability to understand the process and causal interactions in the underlying system. By contrast, the focus here is on explanation, via methods that strive towards abductive reasoning that can offer an explanation (hypothesis) for a set of observations (Gahegan, 2009). Moving from prediction to explanation, specifically explanation based on feasible processes and their interactions, represents a significant and important step for the GIScience. Models will then become useful in terms of their predictive power, and their ability to explain likely processes and mechanisms that generate those predictions. Searching for Explanations Inductive Process Modelling is an example of one kind of approach that can create explanatory models from complex data. It does this using a kind of theory and data soup: the soup contains a set of theory fragments, rules, constraints, and observational data drawn from the system under investigation. Using these building blocks, heuristic search and feedback are used to iteratively assemble pieces together into a chain that links observable variables with each other via causal mechanisms. Since the model produced contains a set of equations with known links to current theory, then it becomes possible to ‘read’ the model; it is essentially a hypothesised mathematical description of the process under investigation. See Asgharbeygi et al. (2006), Sozou et al. (2017) and Gahegan (2019) for more details. When coupled with the descriptive richness of big data, this approach can produce complex and accurate models that can be readily understood, debated and validated. The inductive process modelling community has had good success in constructing models from complex data that describe various spatial and temporal processes. As Langley showed nearly forty years ago, it is possible to ‘discover’ some well-known physical laws from data, such as acceleration due to gravity (Langley, 1981). In this case, the model is simple: just one equation with one rate term, and it can indeed be learned autonomously from experimental data. But more recent work includes discovering ecological models that can describe: complex predatorprey relationships (Bridewell et al, 2008), the occurrence of large algal blooms (Džeroski et al., 2007) and complex reaction networks in systems biology (Džeroski &amp; Todorovski, 2008). All of these examples not only demonstrate excellent results—they are every bit as good as those produced by expert scientists, and sometimes better—but they are also directly comparable with existing models and their correctness (or otherwise) can be debated rationally based on theory, not just on producing the best results following extensive training. Recent work by Langley and Arvay (2016) demonstrates how Inductive Process Modelling can scale to very complex ecological food webs with 15 or more different interacting species, all successfully learned from data describing the observed counts of individual organisms. That’s a very complex model, with an intricate and lagged set of co-dependencies. To give a specifically geographical example of model discovery, imagine that we wish to understand the mechanisms that drive overland water drainage and soil erosion. Some simple examples of equations to add to the process library might be: exponential decay, simple geometric calculations of upslope area, water accumulation, soil erosion coefficients and equations governing fluid flow and saturation. To guide the model discovery process we need a measure of success, which can be straightforwardly defined as a reduction of error in the model’s ability to correctly predict the observed data (say the outflow of the basin or the amount of soil eroded over time). This provides the feedback needed to guide and refine the model’s development. We will also need observation data that describes the variables that appear in the equations in the process library. At the core of the computational model discovery movement is the idea that not only can data be turned into knowledge, but that this knowledge can in turn be expressed as theory (Horacek, 2017; Rule et al., 2018). When the data mining or machine learning community refers to knowledge discovery, it typically means uncovering the patterns and categories that characterize trends or outliers in data; such ‘knowledge’ is usually expressed in the language of data (statistics) or machine learning method parameterisations and not the language of human explanation (domain theory). But in the case of computational model discovery, the discovered knowledge is a mathematical model (e.g. a set of Partial Differential Equations) that characterises some phenomena of interest and that can be translated (via these equations) into rules and relations between data—for example as processes and causal links. This is closer to theory, and can be interpreted from a theoretical perspective in many cases. Over time, as additional layers of the science process are adequately represented in computational systems, these discovery systems will become capable of producing rich and detailed descriptions of solutions and their explanations, couched in relevant domain theory and the process of research.

          "The COVID-19 pandemic led to the creation of a new protest movement, positioned against government lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, and related measures. Efforts to control misinformation by digital platforms resulted in take downs of key accounts and posts. This led some of these protest groups to migrate to platforms with less stringent content moderation policies, such as Telegram. Telegram has also been one of the destinations of the far right, whose deplatforming from mainstream platforms began a few years ago. Given the co-existence of these two movements on Telegram, the article examines their connections. Empirically, the article focused on Irish Telegram groups and channels, identifying relevant protest movements and collecting their posts. Using computational social science methods, we examine whether far-right terms and discourses are present and how this varies across different clusters of Telegram Covid-19 protest groups. In addition, we examine which actors are posting far-right content and what kind of roles they play in the network of Telegram groups. The findings indicate the presence of far-right discourses among the COVID-19 groups. However, the existence of these groups was not solely driven by the extreme right, and the incidence of far-right discourses was not equal across all COVID-19 protest groups. We interpret these findings under the prism of the mediation opportunity structure: while the far right appears to have taken advantage of the network opportunity structure afforded by deplatforming and the migration to Telegram, it did not succeed in diffusing its ideas widely among the COVID-19 protest groups in the Irish Telegram.",
          "Increased computational and multimodal approaches to research over the past decades have enabled scholars and learners to forge creative avenues of inquiry, adopt new methodological approaches, and interrogate information in innovative ways. As such, academic libraries have begun to offer a suite of services to support these digitally inflected and data-intense research strategies. These supports, dubbed digital scholarship services in the library profession, break traditional disciplinary boundaries and highlight the methodological significance of research inquiry. Externally, however, these practices appear as domain-specific niches, e.g., digital history or digital humanities in humanities disciplines, e-science and e-research in STEM, and e-social science or computational social science in social science disciplines. The authors conducted a study examining the meaningfulness of the term digital scholarship within the local context at University of Colorado Boulder by investigating how the interpretation of digital scholarship varies according to graduate students, faculty, and other researchers. Nearly half of the definitions (46 percent) mentioned research process or methods as part of digital scholarship. Faculty and staff declined or were unable to define digital scholarship more often than graduate students or post-doctoral researchers. Therefore, digital scholarship as a term is not meaningful to all researchers. We recommend that librarians inflect their practices with the understanding that researchers and library users’ perceptions of digital scholarship vary greatly across contexts.",

This paper analyzes the characteristics, inducements and negative effects of school bullying. Combine drama courses and working group education methods to intervene in school bullying. Intervention work includes making teenagers aware of bullying behavior and identifying bullying types. To achieve the purpose of empathy through role play, bullies can effectively control irrational thoughts, understand their own cognitive biases, and reconcile their own emotions and behaviors. So that the victims can identify the bullying behavior around them in time, and cultivate their resistance and self-protection awareness in the event of bullying. Based on the empirical analysis of social work to intervene in the practical dilemma, and put forward the corresponding countermeasures to reduce the negative impact of school bullying on all aspects of youth, so as to reduce the various social risks brought by school bullying.",
          "The idea of organizing PEOPLES stemmed from two related observations, namely the availability of large amounts of spontaneous data covering a range of personal aspects and the fact that such aspects are usually studied in isolation.Social media users nowadays freely express what is on their mind at any moment in time, at any location, and about virtually anything.These large amounts of spontaneously produced texts open up a unique opportunity to learn more about such users, e.g., predicting demographic variables (age, gender), but also personality types, as well as emotions and opinion expressions.This observation is not new, of course, and this opportunity has largely been exploited in the recent years, with abundant works on sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and personality.However, such traits of human personality and behavior have indeed attracted a substantial amount of attention but have been mostly studied in isolation, often in different -but related -communities, such as NLP, CL, AI.Therefore, we thought that the time was ripe to bring these communities a step closer to study people's traits and expressions jointly and in their interplay on such large volumes of available data.The communities' response, with 25 received submissions coming from 11 different countries and going well beyond typical NLP topics, proves again this year that there is wide interest at this intersection, and we are happy to be able to provide a context for exchanging ideas.Following the reviewers's advice, 14 papers were selected for inclusion in the proceedings.They cover a wide range of topics related to the three main PEOPLES themes (personality, emotion and opinion), their interaction and the impact of their modeling on social aspects like well-being, political preferences, humor and language use.To further enrich this volume, we additionally invited our keynote speakers to submit position papers that accompany their talks, and are excited that both of our keynotes submitted excellent papers touching upon issues of making NLP models more demographically aware and how researchers from related fields such as demography can benefit from NLP techniques.We hope that this is just the second edition of what will become series of workshops bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, who share an interest in personality, opinion and emotion detection, and especially in researching the intertwining of such traits and expressions.We would like to thank our program committee consisting of 33 researchers from a variety of backgrounds for their insightful and constructive reviews.Without their support, this workshop would not have been possible.In addition, we thank all authors for submitting papers and making PEOPLES a big success.",

          "With the continuous development and improvement of the leniency system for guilty pleas and penalties in China, the study of sentencing recommendations within the system, which closely connects the prosecution, the defense and the trial, has also been continuously emphasized. From the development trend, determining the sentence is the main form of sentencing advice in the future. Moreover, precise sentencing recommendations will ultimately affect the appeal rate by influencing the prosecuted party, the trial party and the criminal process itself. Theoretically, the more precise a sentencing recommendation is, the more likely it is to be inconsistent with the final verdict and thus cause an appeal. However, in practice, through the research methodology of computational social science and the collection and collation of relevant data, it has been concluded that, under the same conditions, accurate sentencing recommendations are effective in reducing the appeal rate in guilty plea cases.",

          "The video game industry plays an essential role in the entertainment sphere of our society. However, from Monopoly to Flight Simulators, serious games have also been appealing tools for learning a new language, conveying values, or training skills. Furthermore, the resurgence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science in the last decade has created a unique opportunity since the amount of data collected through a game is immense, as is the amount of data needed to feed such AI algorithms. This paper aims to identify relevant research lines using Serious Games as a novel research tool, especially in Computational Social Sciences. To contextualize, we also conduct a (non-systematic) literature review of this field. We conclude that the synergy between games and data can foster the use of AI for good and open up new strategies to empower humanity and support social research with novel computational tools. We also discuss the challenges and new opportunities that arise from aspiring to such lofty goals.",
          "Understanding the dynamics of reciprocation is of great interest in sociology and computational social science. The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2 game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections because they require faith in the players that are granted such high access. In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that reciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our hypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations using features from trade interactions. Using the number of trades (both before and after the initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be reciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC.",
          "One of the most controversial issues about norms is whether mental mechanisms are involved at all in their emergence, and if so, which ones. Following its philo- sophical origins, the study of norms reveals a fundamental strabismus: on one hand, social scientists follow analytical philosophers in viewing norms as conventions possibly enforced by social expectations and sanctions; on the other hand, philoso- phers of law and logicians conceptualize norms as specific mental representations. Scholars following Hume and Wittgenstein see norms as behavioral regularities that emerge spontaneously from the bottom up, which means they see no reasons for a specific norm-related form of cognition. Scholars following Kant and Kelsen view instead norms as obligations deliberately issued from the top down by definite authorities, of which reason ranks as the highest. This book argues that norms undergo not only a social, but also a mental dyna- mics, as it is spelled out in the title: minding norms. ￼￼￼￼￼It is about modelling of normative properties according to the paradigm of computational social science. It aims at clarifying to which level of reality norms belong, whether social or mental; what is their role, if any, in the mind; and finally whether norms represent a special kind of representation, or a special motivational factor, or both. More than a new quantita- tive, big-data driven social science, this book highlights the theory building poten- tial of computational social science. Hume had a clear understanding of the strategic structure of human interactions. He was aware that exchange tends to be risky because one or both parties may devi- ate from agreements, default on payment on delivery, or behave in other treacherous manner. Without reliable exchange, agents would be forced to solve all their prob- lems on their own and thus could not engage in division of labor and specialization (p. 68). Kelsen’s deontic philosophy and logic-based theory of action consider as basic normative beliefs, i.e., beliefs that at a given behavior, in a given scenario, for a give set of agents, is either forbidden, obligatory, or permitted (p. 83). Conte and her group propose a general notion of norms that is capable of sub- suming different types and domains of applications as «behaviors spreading over a society on the condition that the corresponding prescriptions and mental represen- tations (namely, sets of beliefs and goals concerning the norms) spread as well». They also display a dynamic model of norms, which is implemented experimen- tally, i.e., simulation-based in an operational version, which is tested on an agent platform that reproduces a different social scenario and makes it clear that norm internalization comes about as the emergence of a two-way dynamics of norm-de- tection and social conformity (p. 4). On the one side norms are emergent properties that collide with downward entities (p. 17), on the other side, social embeddedness comes to play, for there are many aspects of human life that cannot be satisfactorily modeled if one omits either the individual and his/her decision making or the sys- tem of groups and interactions that the individual is embedded in (p. 37). ￼￼￼￼￼￼",
          "Behavioral public policy (BPP) applies behavioral insights to aid policy-making and implementation. Emerging from the interest in nudges in the late 2000s, BPP has matured over the last decade and a half. It has produced new concepts and generated much empirical data, helping researchers and policy-makers understand and explain human behavior with a multidisciplinary lens. Even though BPP is now an established field of endeavor, it has now reached the point when it is important to assess how likely it is to grow as a field. To help understand the dynamics of knowledge innovation and utilization, this article discusses the past, present, and future of behavioral public policy. We draw on the substantive achievements of nudge and BPP, the engagement of policy-makers in nudge units and behavioral policies, the growth of empiricism via experiments, and an emergent ethical concern illustrated by new tools, such as boost and nudge+. Responding to the critical dialog around nudge, we highlight the increasingly prominent role that agency and reasonableness are likely to play in future initiatives. We outline benefits that newer methods, such as computational social sciences, may have on the field. BPP can make sense of heterogeneity while not losing its ability to design simple, low-cost population-based interventions.",
          "Some of the most significant challenges of sustainability can be traced back to the complexity of social and ecological phenomena and the difficulty to connect these with design decisions made at the level of products and business models. Such complex systems are especially difficult to assess and influence as they do not lend themselves to simple causality relations and prediction (Boulton et al, 2015; Jones et al. 2014).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nA few schools of thought in design are explicitly embracing complexity, such as systemic design (Jones et al. 2014) and transition design (Irwin 2018). Building upon insights from complexity science, they encompass a wide range of design methodologies, such as giga- mapping (Sevaldson 2011), system maps (Irwin 2018), or co-creation (e.g. Sanders and Stappers 2008).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe vast majority of methods described in systemic and transition design literature are qualitative in nature. This is in stark contrast with the methods used in complexity science – or complex systems science. This interdisciplinary field of science has been built predominantly upon the use of quantitative, computational models, a number of which have been applied to social phenomena, e.g.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nNetwork theory enables the modelling of a set of elements interacting with each other, such as people in a social group, employees in a company, or companies in a supply chain (Newman 2010). This type of approach has delivered numerous insights, e.g. on the structure of social networks (Scott, 2017), the organisational needs of engineering projects (Sosa et al, 2004), and the robustness of the internet and the web (Réka et al. 2000), as well as to sustainability questions (e.g. Bodin and Tengö 2012)&#13;\\n&#13;\\nSystem dynamics can be used to model a system of interconnected stocks and flows and their evolution over time. This method has been used to assess scenarios of global ecological challenges (Meadows et al. 1972), as well as to inform business model design (Cosenz 2017), conservation initiatives (Johnson et al. 2012) and pathways towards sustainable development (Hjorth and Bagheri 2006).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nAgent-based models provide a way to simulate the dynamics of social systems by placing explicit emphasis on how they emerge from the behaviours of individuals (the ‘agents’) (Van Dam et al. 2012). Their applications include the dynamics of segregation (Schelling 1978, Wilensky 1997), policy analysis (Lempert 2002, Nikolic and Dijkema 2010), and industrial ecology (Axtell et al. 2001).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nSystems of differential equations can be used to represent certain phenomena at aggregated levels, e.g. to give a mathematical representation of the response of societies to societal problems (Scheffer et al. 2003).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nSuch computational models could provide key insights for design for complex systems. Table 1 lists examples of computational models from literature that can be easily connected to a design activity.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nIf computational models have such a potential for design, why haven’t such methods been promoted in the literature on systemic and transition design? We explore the potential causes of this reluctance through three key questions, and deduct lessons for the development of computational methods in design for complex systems, and therefore design for sustainability.&#13;\\n&#13;\\n1. Can humans be modelled?&#13;\\n&#13;\\nIt is fair to ask whether mathematics can usefully describe social phenomena. Supporting this concern, the field of economics has in the past heavily underplayed the complexity of human behaviours, using drastically simplified assumptions to enable mathematical description (Arthur 1999).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe response to this concern is 2-fold. First, models of human behaviours have greatly improved over the past decades, e.g. through behavioural economics. These improved hypotheses however still need to be made explicit in research, as they often reflect certain values and worldviews.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nSecond, today’s online tools have given rise to unprecedented data about human behaviours, through the field of computational social science (Conte et al. 2012). The applications to design are worth considering (Lettieri 2016).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nRecent research (Moat et al. 2014) demonstrates the growing ability of modern techniques to predict social behaviors and, if this weren’t enough warning, recent news headlines highlight the implied risk that this be used to manipulate people. The ethical considerations of modelling humans should thus always be considered carefully.&#13;\\n&#13;\\n2. Are design and modelling practices compatible?&#13;\\n&#13;\\nDeveloping a computational model requires strong critical thinking and rigour. It can thus be more conducive to removing ideas than to creating new ones. Could it stifle the generative, creative thinking that is central to design? Two approaches to avoiding this shortcoming are to carefully think of the phase in which to integrate the use of a model and to leverage intuition and ideas from the designers and stakeholders as inputs into the model.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nData analysis and modelling can be time consuming and require specialised skills, so they can be cost intensive. Budget or planning may therefore motivate their exclusion. What may address this issue is the development of interfaces and platforms enabling the adaptation of existing models to new situations. As an illustration of such solutions, the platform Kumu offers a user-friendly interface for network analysis.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nFinally, designers often question whether such models would support the engagement of stakeholders, as they can come across as dry and complicated. Participatory modelling experiments demonstrate that stakeholder engagement can be an integral part of the modelling process (Schmitt Olabisi et al. 2010), as long as the process is developed with this intent from the start.&#13;\\n&#13;\\n3. Can you model with limited data?&#13;\\n&#13;\\nFinally, some powerful computational models rely on very large datasets from online use, such as Facebook or Twitter data (Conte et al. 2012). A design problem however does not start with a dataset, but with a problem to solve. As a result, not every systemic problem will possess such a dataset. Design by definition takes place at an early stage of intervention, before the project itself has delivered data. Are computational models still relevant in these contexts? Here are a few responses to this concern.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nFirst, many designers may underestimate the amount of data available today, when leveraging online media and advanced data analysis techniques (e.g. natural language processing), which can turn large volumes of unstructured documents into structured datasets (Conte et al. 2012).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nSecond, much can already be learnt form models based on limited data, complemented with plausible assumptions. Uncertain data can also be treated as the source of multiple scenarios (Kwakkel 2013).&#13;\\n&#13;\\nFinally, there is an opportunity to approach models in a lean, iterative manner: a first model is built based on theory and hypotheses, which can already help to explore and refine the assumptions of the stakeholders and designers; such a model will in turn inform which data to gather throughout the project, so that more and more refined versions can be developed iteratively.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nAs the discussion above suggests, there is an opportunity in expanding current design methods with computational models, provided the following considerations:&#13;\\n&#13;\\n• Making assumptions explicit and addressing ethics questions,&#13;\\n• Leveraging data from online tools and big data analysis methods,&#13;\\n• Developing simulation interfaces for designers and stakeholders,&#13;\\n• Leveraging designers and stakeholders’ intuition as input into the model,&#13;\\n• Adopting an iterative approach to model building.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe next steps in demonstrating this potential is to build case studies of design projects leveraging computational models. Adequate cases would concern issues affected by social complexity, which means that the interactions between individuals play a key a role in outcomes. Ideally, data sets should be available, either from the start of the project or through its development. Finally, such projects will require stakeholders that are curious and willing to experiment with new approaches.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nThis paper showed that despite the fact that much of complexity science is based on quantitative, computational models, the literature on design concerned with complex systems refers nearly exclusively to qualitative approaches. It explored some of the key questions that may be motivating this reluctance to leverage computational models of social systems, deducted a set of guiding principles for their introduction in design for sustainability, and proposed next steps to this endeavour.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nGiven the urgency to address some of today’s societal questions, no stone should be left unturned. Computational models have repeatedly proved their power to shed light on complex social dynamics of importance to sustainability. It is time to explore their application to the field of a design to enable the transition towards sustainable societies.",

          "The Sustainable Development Goals are global objectives set by the UN. They cover fundamental issues in development such as poverty, education, economic growth, and climate. Despite growing data across policy dimensions, popular statistical approaches offer limited solutions as these datasets are not big or detailed enough to meet their technical requirements. Complexity Economics and Sustainable Development provides a novel framework to handle these challenging features, suggesting that complexity science, agent-based modelling, and computational social science can overcome these limitations. Building on interdisciplinary socioeconomic theory, it provides a new framework to quantify the link between public expenditure and development while accounting for complex interdependencies and public governance. Accompanied by comprehensive data of worldwide development indicators and open-source code, it provides a detailed construction of the analytic toolkit, familiarising readers with a diverse set of empirical applications and drawing policy implications that are insightful to a diverse readership. This title is also available as open access on Cambridge Core.",
          "Social enterprises are unique organizations that help in solving social problems including poverty, women and children oppression, and environmental conservation. Yet, these organizations are confronted with constraints such as funding, policy disadvantages and some other limitations that pose a threat to the sustainability of the project. This research uses Graph Neural Networks to verify how entities interact in the context of social enterprises, the performance indicators, and the issues that they experience. To build up the directed graph showing details about the four highlighted social enterprises–Grameen Bank, BRAC, SEWA and Eco-Enterprises along with their goals and challenges, such as poverty reduction, scalability, sustainability and funding constraints, and policy gaps, each of the four has been highlighted as below: The GNN analysis in this study provides a clear understanding of interaction between them, as important challenge like funding and policy gaps becomes clear as the factors hindering success. The paper also discusses the ability of GNNs to capture various types of relations and provides recommendations for social ventures, government, and financiers. The implications highlight the role of general, sustainable development objectives to address the issues of scalability and in relation to the policy dimensions. The study contributes to the existing literature on methods of computational social sciences and presents a novel approach leveraging GNNs for social enterprise analysis and presents the applicability of GNNs in enhancing decision making and strategic planning for social enterprises.",
          "Abstract This paper reports on the development of a metadata application profile (AP), MetaFAIR, designed to support research data management (RDM) to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The development of MetaFAIR followed a three‐step process that included learning about the characteristics of datasets from researchers to establish their context and requirements, as well as iterative design and testing with researchers' feedback. Guided by the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), MetaFAIR focuses on accommodating description needs particular to computational social science datasets while seeking to provide general enough elements to describe data collections across many different domains. In this paper, MetaFAIR is placed in the context of historical and recent developments in the areas of RDM and application profile creation; following this contextualization, the paper describes the central considerations and challenges of the MetaFAIR development process and discusses its significance for future work in RDM.",

          "Social simulation research seeks to understand the dynamics of complex human behavior by simulating populations of individual decision-makers as multi-agent systems. However, prior work in games and entertainment fail to account for interactions between social behavior, geography, and relationships in a manner that allows researchers to easily reuse their frameworks and model social characters. We present Anthology, an extensible software framework for modeling human social systems, within the context of an ongoing research agenda to integrate AI techniques from social simulation games and computational social science to enable researchers to model and reason about the complex dynamics of human social behavior. Anthology comprises a motive-based agent decision making algorithm; a knowledge representation system for relationships; a flexible specification language for precondition-effect-style actions; a user interface to inspect and interact with the simulation as it runs in real-time; and an extensive user documentation and reference manual. We describe our participatory research design process used for the developing Anthology, the state of the current system, it's limitations and our future development directions.",
          "An immersive, interactive environment and the non-player characters populating it often play a key role in interactive narrative experiences. We posit that if a procedurally generated narrative is better able to reflect real-world attributes of the player's surroundings, then the experience would be more transportive for the player. With this comes the problem of generating believable narratives and characters for an open, complex, real world. Simulating such a society within the constraints of the real environment, and allowing for virtual characters to more accurately mimic human behavior could increase the believability of the agents. The interactions amongst these agents sharing their cultural views, biases, and histories based on their real-world geolocation could inform the study of audience modeling and machine enculturation, allowing computers to learn or reason about social norms in regions. Finally, we posit this research would afford better applications in the field of entertainment or computational social science.",
          "Abstract The economic shock of the Covid-19 crisis has disproportionately impacted small businesses and the self-employed. Around the globe, their survival during the pandemic often relied heavily on government assistance. This article explores how economic relief to business is understood through the lens of deservingness in the public. It examines the case of Germany, where the government has responded to the pandemic by implementing an extensive support programme. Notably, in this context, the self-employed are typically outsiders to the state insurance system. Combining computational social science methods and a qualitative analysis, the article focuses on the debate about direct subsidies on the social media platform Twitter/X between March 2020 and June 2021. It traces variation in the patterns of claim making in what is a rich debate about pandemic state support, finding that this discourse is characterised by the concern that economic relief threatens to blur existing boundaries of worth in society. The reciprocity principle of deservingness theory is pivotal in asserting business identities in times of crisis, yet it also reveals a fundamentally ambiguous relationship with the principle of need. Additionally, the claim of justice-as-redress, as a novel dimension of reciprocity, surfaces as an important theme in this debate.",
          "Abduction is an inference approach that uses data and observations to identify plausible (and preferably, best) explanations for phenomena. Applications of abduction (e.g., robotics, genetics, image understanding) have largely been devoid of human behavior. Here, we devise and execute an iterative abductive analysis process that is driven by the social sciences: behaviors and interactions among groups of human subjects. One goal is to understand intra-group cooperation and its effect on fostering collective identity. We build an online game platform; perform and analyze controlled laboratory experiments; form hypotheses; build, exercise, and evaluate network-based agent-based models; and evaluate the hypotheses in multiple abductive iterations, improving our understanding as the process unfolds. While the experimental results are of interest, the paper's thrust is methodological, and indeed establishes the potential of iterative abductive looping for the (computational) social sciences.",

          "Kinship is an essential factor in human social life. Many years of research devoted to develop a better understanding of kinship bear witness to this fact. Important advances were made on conceptual, modeling and empirical grounds. Computational social science---in particular through social network analysis and social simulation---contributed its part to it. Notwithstanding, multiagent simulations of social systems rarely take into account kinship-based social interactions, especially when claiming to be empirical. We combine generative social science's basal argument \"grow it!\" with the concept that social structure is not reified, but a pattern emerging from interactions between individuals, and introduce a multiagent social simulation that \"grows\" kinship structures on the basis of socio-demographic and marriage interactions in Pakistan's Rural North-West Frontier Province. The modeling proposed has generalizable demonstrator value in that it is shown how published ethnographic data can be used in building credible and cross-validateable formal models that then can be re-used in modular model building of larger models of society. We conclude with a critical discussion of taking into account endogenized social structure in formal models of conflict.",
          "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Emotional support is crucial in enhancing social interactions, facilitating psychological interventions, and improving customer service outcomes by addressing individuals' emotional needs. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers potential for delivering emotional support on a large scale, but their effectiveness compared to human counselors has not been well understood. Evaluating and enhancing the emotional support capabilities of LLMs through targeted user-centered strategies is crucial for their successful real-world integration. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This study aims to evaluate the emotional support capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4o, and to introduce an integrative automatic evaluation framework focused on user perceived feedback (UPF). The framework seeks to enhance LLM performance in emotional support conversations (ESCs) by identifying psycholinguistic clues as intrinsic evaluation metrics and utilizing a customized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> The study utilized a dataset of ESCs from human counselors to develop an explanatory predictive model using explainable artificial intelligence methods, following an integrative modeling paradigm rooted in computational social science. This model was designed to evaluate and interpret UPF scores for GPT-4o. Additionally, Hill's three-stage model of helping was integrated into a manually customized CoT prompting framework to evaluate GPT-4o's performance in ESCs. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> GPT-4o achieved high UPF scores, demonstrating relative stability in performance, but it still significantly lags behind human counselors overall (Cliff's Delta = 0.087, P &lt; 0.001). The evaluation framework identified 41 distinct linguistic clues related to emotional expression, social dynamics, cognitive processes, linguistic style, and decision-making stages, enhancing the understanding of both processes and outcomes in ESCs. Notably, GPT-4o's UPF scores significantly improved with the use of manually customized COT prompts (Cohen's d = 0.378, P &lt; 0.001), showing no significant difference from the average performance of human counselors overall (Cliff's Delta = -0.014, P= 0.47). However, the COT prompts demonstrated a considerable advantage in specific emotion categories such as fear (Cliff's Delta = -0.23, P = 0.002), sadness (Cliff's Delta = -0.105, P = 0.012), and issues related to breakups with partners (Cliff's Delta = -0.06, P = 0.254). Compared to human counselors, GPT-4o is effective in reducing negative language and conveying emotional tone, but its overemphasis on emotional content weakens its causal reasoning, engagement prompting, and cognitive depth, limiting its ability to handle complex questions and scenarios. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This study offers preliminary evidence of GPT-4o's emotional support capabilities and introduces a UPF-centered integrative evaluation framework for ESCs. The findings suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for applying advanced LLMs in emotional support services, though significant challenges persist, particularly in deepening conversational exploration and personalizing language. The proposed framework emphasizes the integration of human expertise into LLMs, enhancing their efficacy and contributing to developing trustworthy AI-based emotional support services. </sec>",
          "The increasing availability of huge volumes of social media ‘Big Data’ from Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter and other social network platforms, combined with the development of software designed to operate at web scale, has fuelled the growth of computational social science. Often analysed by ‘data scientists’, social media data differ substantially from the datasets officially disseminated as by-products of government-sponsored activity, such as population censuses or administrative data, which have long been analysed by professional statisticians. This chapter outlines the characteristics of social media data and identifies key data sources and methods of data capture, introducing several of the technologies used to acquire, store, query, visualise and augment social media data. Unrepresentativeness of, and lack of (geo)demographic control in, social media data are problematic for population-based research. These limitations, alongside wider epistemological and ethical concerns surrounding data validity, inadvertent co-option into research and protection of user privacy, suggest that caution should be exercised when analysing social media datasets. While care must be taken to respect personal privacy and sample assiduously, this chapter concludes that statisticians, who may be unfamiliar with some of the programmatic steps involved in accessing social media data, must play a pivotal role in analysing it.",
          "We present a working system for large scale quantitative narrative analysis (QNA) of news corpora, which includes various recent ideas from text mining and pattern analysis in order to solve a problem arising in computational social sciences. The task is that of identifying the key actors in a body of news, and the actions they perform, so that further analysis can be carried out. This step is normally performed by hand and is very labour intensive. We then characterise the actors by: studying their position in the overall network of actors and actions; studying the time series associated with some of their properties; generating scatter plots describing the subject/object bias of each actor; and investigating the types of actions each actor is most associated with. The system is demonstrated on a set of 100,000 articles about crime appeared on the New York Times between 1987 and 2007. As an example, we find that Men were most commonly responsible for crimes against the person, while Women and Children were most often victims of those crimes.",
          "This PhD is about the design, development and evaluation of the Social Data Analytics Tool (SODATO) to collect, store, analyze, and report big social data emanating from the social media engagement of and social media conversations about organizations. Situated with in the academic domains of Data Science, Computational Social Science and Information Systems, the PhD project addressed two general research questions about the technological architectures and design principles for big social data analytics in an organisational context.<br/>The PhD project is grounded in the theory of socio-technical interactions for better understanding perception of, and action on, the screen when individuals use social media platforms such as Facebook. Based on the theory of socio-technical interactions, a conceptual model of social data was generated. This conceptual model of social data model consists of two components: social graph and social text. The social graph consists of the structure of the relationships emerging from social media appropriation and focuses on identifying the actors involved, the actions they take, the activities they engage in, and the artefacts they create and interact with. Social text consists of the communicative and linguistic aspects of the social media interaction such as the topics discussed, keywords mentioned, pronouns used and sentiments expressed. The conceptual model of social data is then used to specify the formal model of social data using the mathematics of set theory. <br/>The design science methodological framework of Action Design Research (ADR) was employed to create the ITArtefact, Social Data Analytics Tool (SODATO) in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders. In order to evaluate the rigour and relevance of SODATO for conducting different kinds of academic and industry analysis, the tool was utilized in four different domain-specific empirical case studies covering the range of predictive, prescriptive, descriptive and visual analytics paradigms. <br/>The contributions of the PhD project include the IT-Artefact SODATO itself, the triadic model of design science contributions consisting of design propositions, design principles, and software design patterns for big social data analytics in general, and an analytical framework for set-theoretical computational social science.",
          "As an interdisciplinary field, data-driven journalism integrates the intellectual origins of investigative journalism, computer-assisted reporting, and the emerging paradigm of computational social science. Studies of news production have revealed, however, that news professionals are reinforcing existing power structures via an interpretive community, where homophily-evoked social interactions—even in the social media context—create echo chambers and discussion fragmentation. Is the representation of data-driven journalism in the electronic public sphere breaking boundaries among people from different domains or does it resemble the existing power structure? This study adopts a network analytics approach and constructs a representational network among actors who joined the public discussion of data-driven journalism in the Twittersphere—the co-retweeted network—such that two accounts are connected if their tweets are retweeted by the same user. Public tweets containing search queries related to data-driven journalism published from February 2017 to February 2018 were collected with Twitter real-time streaming application programming interface (API). A co-retweeted network with 1,148 accounts was derived from verified accounts’ retweeting posts. Results found that several communities emerged, and news organizations, nongovernmental and nonprofit professional organizations, and academic institutions were in the crucial positions of the network. The exponential random graph models (ERGMs) based on this network revealed the extent to which gender, geographical location, and institutional type of the users were associated with the tie-formation. This study documents the major actors who are discussing the subject of data-driven journalism and raises critical reflections toward the interdisciplinary collaboration in the production of public knowledge.",
          "The DARPA Ground Truth project sought to evaluate social science by constructing four varied simulated social worlds with hidden causality and unleashed teams of scientists to collect data, discover their causal structure, predict their future, and prescribe policies to create desired outcomes. This large-scale, long-term experiment of in silico social science, about which the ground truth of simulated worlds was known, but not by us, reveals the limits of contemporary quantitative social science methodology. First, problem solving without a shared ontology-in which many world characteristics remain existentially uncertain-poses strong limits to quantitative analysis even when scientists share a common task, and suggests how they could become insurmountable without it. Second, data labels biased the associations our analysts made and assumptions they employed, often away from the simulated causal processes those labels signified, suggesting limits on the degree to which analytic concepts developed in one domain may port to others. Third, the current standard for computational social science publication is a demonstration of novel causes, but this limits the relevance of models to solve problems and propose policies that benefit from the simpler and less surprising answers associated with most important causes, or the combination of all causes. Fourth, most singular quantitative methods applied on their own did not help to solve most analytical challenges, and we explored a range of established and emerging methods, including probabilistic programming, deep neural networks, systems of predictive probabilistic finite state machines, and more to achieve plausible solutions. However, despite these limitations common to the current practice of computational social science, we find on the positive side that even imperfect knowledge can be sufficient to identify robust prediction if a more pluralistic approach is applied. Applying competing approaches by distinct subteams, including at one point the vast TopCoder.com global community of problem solvers, enabled discovery of many aspects of the relevant structure underlying worlds that singular methods could not. Together, these lessons suggest how different a policy-oriented computational social science would be than the computational social science we have inherited. Computational social science that serves policy would need to endure more failure, sustain more diversity, maintain more uncertainty, and allow for more complexity than current institutions support.",

          "While the ICT for Development (ICTD) community is well aware about the far-reaching changes introduced by the digital age, it is remarkably slowly getting used to the idea that digital tools also revolutionize its very own core business: research. Information and communication technology (ICT) is currently transforming the way knowledge is created and insights are obtained. This applies to inductive empirical inquiry (i.e. 'Big data'), as well as deductive theoretical scholarship (i.e. 'agent-based computer simulations'). This article explores best practices of the application of such Computational Social Science in the field of development and contributes an informed perspective to intensify an outstanding discussion within the ICTD community. ICT should not only be used for development (ICTD), but also for the constant updating of our understanding of digital development, in order to fine-tune policies and project designs: 'ICT4ICTD'. On the one hand, the article shows that the consideration of this double role of ICT has the potential to significantly increase the impact of ICTD. On the other hand, developing countries and the ICTD community face important challenges when applying these tools, which should never be adopted uncritically.",
          "<title>Abstract</title> <bold>Purpose:</bold> The primary goal of the study is to use YouTube as a data source to examine public opinion about the ethnic conflict or tension between the Meitei and Kuki communities of Manipur, India. It investigates how digital platforms reflect emotional engagement with regional conflict and evaluates machine learning models for sentiment classification in this context. <bold>Methodology:</bold> A dataset of 551 YouTube videos and 124,971 associated comments were collected through Webometric Analyst and preprocessed using natural language processing techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization. Four models for machine learning to classify comments into positive, neutral, or negative attitudes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were trained and evaluated. The model's performance was evaluated using its F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision. <bold>Findings:</bold> SVM achieved the highest accuracy (93.42%), followed closely by Random Forest (91.59%). Many comments were neutral, while positive sentiments marginally exceeded negative ones. The sentiment distribution suggests a complex emotional response, including empathy and calls for peace. The top 10 most-viewed videos revealed various content types, from news and interviews to political commentary and vlogs, indicating diverse user engagement with the issue. <bold>Originality:</bold> This study presents one of the first applications of machine learning-based sentiment analysis to YouTube content on the Manipur conflict. It contributes original insights to computational social science and digital media research by demonstrating how user-generated video content can assess public sentiment in real time. The findings offer methodological and substantive value, particularly in understanding how digital discourse shapes perceptions of ethnic conflict in India.",
          "story grammar, triplets, semantic graphs, computational social science Abstract � We present a methodology for large scale quantitative narrative analysis (QNA) of text data, which includes various recent ideas from text mining and pattern analysis in order to solve a problem arising in digital humanities and social sciences. The key idea is to automatically transform the corpus into a network, by extracting the key actors and objects of the narration, linking them to form a network, and then analyzing this network to extract information about those actors. These actors can be characterized by: studying their position in the overall network of actors and actions; generating scatter plots describing the subject/object bias of each actor; and investigating the types of actions each actor is most associated with. The software pipeline is demonstrated on text obtained from three story books from the Gutenberg Project. Our analysis reveals that our approach correctly identifies the most central actors in a given narrative. We also find that the hero of a narrative always has the highest degree in a network. They are most often the subjects of actions, but not the ones with the highest subject bias score. Our methodology is very scalable, and addresses specific research needs that are currently very labour intensive in social sciences and digital humanities. 1.",
          "I present new measures of generosity, coverage and institutional characteristics of work-injury policy across 189 countries in the Global Work-Injury Policy Dataset (GWIP) version 2.0. To date, major research efforts produced detailed social policy data for the rich Western countries, and more recently countries of Eastern, Central and Central-Eastern Europe. One of the products of this work, the Social Insurance Entitlements Dataset (SIED) has become a benchmark for social policy research. Using hand-coded data, indicators from the International Labor Organization, and the U.S. Social Security Administration’s ‘Social Security Programs Throughout the World’, and computational social science, I demonstrate a process to successfully extend and harmonize the SIED work-injury coverage and generosity variables to cover the Global South; in total 167 countries, plus a further 189 with imputation for the year 2020 or latest. These data will help further various welfare state and social policy research agendas, in particular in the area of work-injury policy which is often understudied in comparison to other social security policies. I analyze to classic hypotheses in welfare state research to demonstrate and guide the potential contribution of these data. One is a logic of industrialization and the other a cultural values hypothesis about work-injury policy development.",
          "Computational social science represents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of reality based on advanced computer tools. From economics to political science, from journalism to sociology, digital approaches and techniques for the analysis and management of large quantities of data have now been adopted in several disciplines. The papers in this JCOM commentary focus on the use of such approaches and techniques in the research on science communication. As the papers point out, the most significant advantages of a computational approach in this sector include the chance to open up a range of new research opportunities: from the study of technical and scientific controversies to citizen science, from the definition of new norms and practices for science journalism to open science issues. On the other hand, difficulties are shared with other areas of application. The main risk is that the large quantity of data available can overwhelm the importance of theory. Instead, as the papers in this commentary demonstrate, big data should push scientists to pursue a deeper epistemological and methodological reflection also in the research on science communication.",

Analyzing the complex and deductively intractable “governance cycle” that plays out in the high-dimensional issue spaces of parliamentary systems, we use two different computational approaches. One models functionally rational politicians who deploy rules of thumb to navigate their complex environment. The other deploys an artificial intelligence algorithm which systematic learns, from massively repeated self-play, to find near-optimal strategies. Future work made possible by greater computational firepower would enable better AI, more realistic ABMs, and the modeling of logrolling under the conditions of incomplete information which characterize most real-world bargaining and negotiation.",
          "This report surveys and systematizes the emerging field of topological methods for discourse analysis and large language models. It proposes that the “shape” of discourse—its holes, loops, voids, and hierarchies—carries as much signal as lexical or embedding-based similarity. Building on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), the text constructs discourse as simplicial complexes and examines homological invariants such as Betti numbers to detect narrative tie-backs, structural gaps, and multi-threaded literary cavities. Persistent homology and the SIFTS algorithm are used to recover temporal “time skeletons” and quantify narrative regimes in both individual documents and public media streams. The report then turns to sheaf theory as a language for opinion dynamics, modeling the distinction between private belief spaces and public discourse along network edges, and using sheaf cohomology to characterize global consensus, polarization, and “learning to lie” as topological obstructions. Hyperbolic geometry is introduced as the natural embedding space for hierarchical discourse structures such as Rhetorical Structure Theory trees, enabling compact Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings and hyperbolic graph neural networks that preserve tree-like expansion. Finally, the work synthesizes these ingredients in the context of foundation models via Stochastic Topological Memory Embeddings (STME). Here, LLM memory is augmented with persistent homology features and topological signatures that stabilize long-range narrative coherence, enable “wormhole” connections between distant contexts, and exhibit resilience under synthetic perturbations. Across these layers—homology, sheaves, hyperbolic embeddings, and topological memory—the report argues for “topological priors” as a missing structural backbone for discourse-aware AI systems and computational social science.",
          "This special issue of the Social Science Computer Review provides a sample of the latest strategies employing large data sets in social media and political communication research. The proliferation of information communication technologies, social media, and the Internet, alongside the ubiquity of high-performance computing and storage technologies, has ushered in the era of computational social science. However, in no way does the use of “big data” represent a standardized area of inquiry in any field. This article briefly summarizes pressing issues when employing big data for political communication research. Major challenges remain to ensure the validity and generalizability of findings. Strong theoretical arguments are still a central part of conducting meaningful research. In addition, ethical practices concerning how data are collected remain an area of open discussion. The article surveys studies that offer unique and creative ways to combine methods and introduce new tools while at the same time address some solutions to ethical questions.",
          "Social evaluation, i.e., people’s views of self, others, and groups, is ubiquitous and embedded in our language. In turn, social evaluative words are used intensively in studies of human social evaluation. However, standardized Chinese word lists for social evaluation are under-developed; the only available word lists are based on the big-two model of social evaluation (i.e., agency and warmth) and cover small numbers of words. To fill the gap, we conducted a survey with a relatively large sample (n = 1270, 50% female) and a large number of words (1908) that might describe extended social evaluative dimensions: appearance, socioeconomic status, sociability, competence, and morality. The participants rated the extent to which each word described a certain social evaluation dimension and how positive/negative each word was. Based on this dataset, we selected words that dominantly describe one of the five above-mentioned dimensions. The final word list has 1040 words, including 245 appearance words (143 positive, 11 neutral, 91 negative), 108 socioeconomic status words (36 positive, 2 neutral, 70 negative), 93 sociability words (53 positive, 5 neutral, 35 negative), 261 competence words (185 positive, 4 neutral, 72 negative), and 333 morality words (149 positive, 1 neutral, 183 negative). This word list provides an extended Chinese social evaluative word list and will serve as a useful resource for researchers in social psychology, linguistics, sociology, and computational social science.",

          "Social media users can easily be offended or hurt on those platforms, which leads to discomfort and health issues such as stress and anxiety. Forgiveness plays an important role to maintain healthy online relationships, which is the central constituent of social dynamics, from cooperation to social cohesion. While most prior studies have focused on analyzing forgiveness factors in offline settings using statistical methods, this study offers a new perspective using a two-staged approach whereby a research model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), and then the results were used as inputs for artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL) models. An agent-based simulation was then performed to shed light on a possible use of the implemented models. Combining ANN and FL provided more accurate prediction results. In addition, simulation experiments call attention to the potential benefits of forgiveness in maintaining connectedness in a social network. The main purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the applicability of soft computing techniques on forgiveness prediction. Instead of relying on data mining techniques, we looked into questions that can improve our understanding of how society works in a digital age. In addition, this study provides an interesting example of a different and insightful way of doing computational social science that is useful to both researchers and practitioners.",
          "Abstract Sociology is a science concerned with both the interpretive understanding of social action and the corresponding causal explanation, process, and result. A causal explanation should be the foundation of prediction. For many years, due to data and computing power constraints, quantitative research in social science has primarily focused on statistical tests to analyze correlations and causality, leaving predictions largely ignored. By sorting out the historical context of \"social prediction,\" this article redefines this concept by introducing why and how machine learning can help prediction in a scientific way. Furthermore, this article summarizes the academic value and governance value of social prediction and suggests that it is a potential breakthrough in the contemporary social research paradigm. We believe that through machine learning, we can witness the advent of an era of a paradigm shift from correlation and causality to social prediction. This shift will provide a rare opportunity for sociology in China to become the international frontier of computational social sciences and accelerate the construction of philosophy and social science with Chinese characteristics.",
          "IPUMS is the world's largest population database. It provides individual-level data on the characteristics of 2.5 billion persons residing in a billion households drawn from over 3,000 censuses and surveys of 165 countries between 1703 and 2024.

          "The rapid growth of social media in Indonesia has given rise to social phenomena such as Fear of Missing Out (FOMO). Expressions of FOMO on platforms like X (previously Twitter) often written informally, filled with abbreviations, slang, and emotional nuances, posing challenges for traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. This research aims to develop an optimized sentiment classification model for FOMO-related posts by fine-tuning the IndoBERT architecture and applying comprehensive data enhancement strategies. The study introduces three key innovations: (1) systematic text normalization to handle informal expressions, (2) a hybrid labeling framework combining automated model prediction, lexicon-based validation, and manual annotation to construct high-quality ground-truth data, and (3) hyperparameter tuning using both GridSearchCV for traditional machine learning models and Bayesian Optimization (Optuna) for deep learning models to maximize performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimized IndoBERT achieved superior performance with an Accuracy of 94.50%, F1-Score of 94.52%, and Macro AUC of 0.987. These results significantly surpass comparative models, including BiLSTM (Accuracy 86.60%), Support Vector Machine (88.06%), and Naive Bayes (80.73%). These results confirm that integrating hybrid labeling and fine-tuned IndoBERT significantly enhances sentiment classification performance. The findings contribute to developing reliable sentiment analysis systems for detecting social anxiety dynamics and computational social science research in Indonesian contexts.",

We conclude with a discussion of best practices for the production and reuse of computational social science images for public consumption.",
          "Currently, there is a shortage of publications that would meaningfully present the experience of comprehensive studies of value orientations of the population using methods of computational social sciences (CSS). This article contains an attempt to analyze the thematic repertoire of studies related to the identification and measurement of value orientations of the population, which are based on CSS methods. The research material was publications retrieved from the OpenAlex search engine for world scientific publications, as well as scientific libraries GoogleScholar, Еlibrary.ru, CyberLeninka, and ResearchGate. This review includes the results of a meaningful analysis of 140 publications published between 2010 and 2023 (79 foreign and 61 Russian). Thus, four thematic groups have been identified. The first group presents the results of ranking the value orientations of the population. The second contains studies reflecting the relationship between religious ideas and value orientations. The third is a study of the value of family. The fourth contains studies that represent the value of nature for humans. It is shown that Russian researchers more often choose the VKontakte platform as a source of data, less often Twitter and open data (for example, search queries in Yandex). Foreign researchers, in turn, widely use open data, various platforms, including administrative ones, as well as various social networks (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook), and photographs on Instagram. In the Russian segment, studies on specific local communities and value orientations of subscribers are quite popular, while in the West, a news feed or a specific hash tag is often taken as a basis. It has been proven that CSS methods make it possible to carry out both crosssectional measurements of the value orientations of the population and to study the dynamics of their development. Two vectors of Russian research have been identified, associated with (1) the study of the basic, terminal values of the population and their changes over time, and (2) the identification, measurement and ranking of value orientations, including those of young people. It has been determined that in Russian discourse the most popular studies are around family, a basic terminal value. It is concluded that research related to the representation of traditional and basic values for the country (patriotism, citizenship, the priority of the spiritual over the material, etc.) is relevant for Russian science.",
          "In this paper we use a computer model of social capital to explore and develop a computational social theory of the anthropological or interpretive notion of the sub jectivity (Ortner 2005). The cultural sub jectivity is a social theory of the reflexive actor that is historically situated in a material and cultural context. It is important for computational social science to begin developing tools to represent the dimensions of the actor in terms of the sub jectivity because it recognizes and seeks to explain the complexity of human feelings and fears in creating meaning and in taking action. Theories of sub jectivity also offer a model of human action and play that is neither universal nor individual. Developing a computational social theory of the sub jectivity is an impossible and improbable task, however, in seeking to develop this theory in code we might be able to posit clearer questions in social research regarding the sub jectivity and explore the operational limits of computational social science, which is a theory in itself. Also accounting for how complex structures of feeling and experienceanxieties, fears, dreams, hopes and the likedevelop as a component inside complex social organizations, ones that can be rigorously explored with computational methods, a foundation can be created for a critical computational social science.

          "Abstract Sociologists encounter digitized data in all aspects of social life, albeit data of indefinite quality. This chapter asks, “How might scholars use the process of inspecting and cleaning such data as an occasion to advance social theory?” It draws on Art Stinchcombe’s theory of formality to demonstrate how the craft of data wrangling can be used to assess and improve the quality of concepts. Drawing on examples from contemporary computational social science, it shows how the cognitive adequacy, communicability, and improvability of conceptual abstractions can be developed and refined in the data wrangling process. Using Stinchcombe to highlight the link between theorizing and the organizational and institutional systems in which such theorizing is embedded, the chapter argues that the systems that affect the quality of data simultaneously affect the quality of concepts. Inspired by AI oversight research, the chapter provides a roadmap for evaluating the systems involved in computational abstractions.",
          "Machine learning and other computer-driven prediction models are one of the fastest growing trends in computational social science. These methods and approaches were developed in computer science and with different goals and epistemologies than those in social science. The most obvious difference being a focus on prediction versus explanation. Predictive modeling offers great potential for improving research and theory development, but its adoption poses some challenges and creates new problems. For this reason, Hofman et al. published recommendations for more effective integration of predictive modeling into social science. In this communication, I review their recommendations and expand on some additional concerns related to current practices and whether prediction can effectively serve the goals of most social scientists. Overall, I argue they provide a sound set of guidelines and a classification scheme that will serve those of us working in computational social science.",

Our study investigated three controversial events intensely discussed on Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter), with a focus on the linkage between morality/emotion and social media in a non-Western cultural context. We found (1) more moral content than non-moral content in the online discussion across the three events, (2) no delay of hourly aggregated moral/emotional content between individual posts and media posts, and (3) posts with stronger but heterogeneous emotions attract more retweets, comments, and likes, while homogenous moral foundations in a post can gain more comments and likes but not retweets.KEYWORDS: MoralityemotionChinese social mediamoral foundations theoryuser engagementWeibo Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 Searching keyword \"Chinese social media research\" on Google Scholar, returns 3,800,000 results, while \"Facebook social media research\" returns 5,410,000 results, let alone other western social media such as Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, etc.2 Data and code are available on OSF: https://osf.io/b7rjk/?view_only=569f284163104f37a1b5f5af43d9386bAdditional informationFundingThis work was supported by China National Social Science Foundation, 22BXW045.Notes on contributorsYibei ChenYibei Chen (Ph.D., University of California, Santa Barabra) is a Postdoctoral Associate at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

          "Computational Social Science emerged as a highly technical and popular discipline in the last few years, owing to the substantial advances in communication technology and daily production of vast quantities of personal data. As per capita data production significantly increased in the last decade, both in terms of its size, bytes, as well as its detail, heart rate monitors, Internet connected appliances, smartphones, social scientists ability to extract meaningful social, political and demographic information from digital data also increased. A vast methodological gap exists in computational international relations, or ComInt, which refers to the use of one or a combination of tools such as data mining, natural language processing, automated text analysis, web scraping, geospatial analysis and machine learning to provide larger and better organized data to test more advanced theories of IR. After providing an overview of the potentials of computational IR and how an IR scholar can establish technical proficiency in computer science, such as starting with Python, R, QGis, ArcGIS or Github, this paper will focus on some of the author's works in providing an idea for IR students on how to think about computational IR. The paper argues that computational methods transcend the methodological schism between qualitative and quantitative approaches and form a solid foundation for building truly multi method research design.",
          "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in a few decades, have outperformed the existing state of the art methods in classification context. However, in the way they were formalised, CNNs are bound to operate on euclidean spaces. Indeed, convolution is a signal operation that are defined on euclidean spaces. This has restricted deep learning main use to euclidean-defined data such as sound or image. And yet, numerous computer application fields (among which network analysis, computational social science, chemo-informatics or computer graphics) induce non-euclideanly defined data such as graphs, networks or manifolds. In this paper we propose a new convolution neural network architecture, defined directly into graph space. Convolution and pooling operators are defined in graph domain. We show its usability in a back-propagation context. Experimental results show that our model performance is at state of the art level on simple tasks. It shows robustness with respect to graph domain changes and improvement with respect to other euclidean and non-euclidean convolutional architectures.",

          "Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to an abundance of online discourse: claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts. This constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into mis- / disinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs promise to provide the key to a Web of structured information, they are mainly focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity, connection or temporal evolution of online discourse. As opposed to facts, claims and viewpoints are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities from computational social science, to argumentation mining, fact-checking, or viewpoint/stance detection. The 2nd International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse Analysis (BeyondFacts'22, equivalently abbreviated as KnOD'22) aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It addresses the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of studies into the analysis of societal debates.",
          "What is universal about music across human societies, and what varies? We built a corpus of ethnographic text on musical behavior from a representative sample of the world’s societies and a discography of audio recordings of the music itself. The ethnographic corpus reveals that music appears in every society observed; that variation in musical behavior is well-characterized by three dimensions, which capture the formality, arousal, and religiosity of song events; that musical behavior varies more within societies than across societies on these dimensions; and that music is regularly associated with behavioral contexts such as infant care, healing, dance, and love. The discography, analyzed through four representations (machine summaries, listener ratings, expert annotations, expert transcriptions), revealed that identifiable acoustic features of songs predict their primary behavioral function worldwide, and that these features fall along two dimensions, melodic and rhythmic complexity. These analyses show how applying the tools of computational social science to rich bodies of humanistic data can reveal both universal features and patterns of variability in culture, addressing longstanding debates about each.",

          "We propose a complex systems approach to the study of political belief systems, to overcome some of the fragmentation in the current scholarship on ideology. We review relevant work in psychology, sociology, and political science and identify major cleavages in the literature: the spatial vs. non-spatial divide (ideologies as reducible to a spatially organized set of dimensions vs. as complex conceptual structures) and the person-group problem (ideologies as driven by psychological needs of individuals vs. by institutional and power structures of society). We argue that construing ideologies as conceptual networks of cognitive-affective representations embedded in social networks of people may provide a path for bridging these existing gaps and epistemological disputes. Tools from cognitive science and computational social science such as cognitive-affective mapping, connectionist simulations, and agent-based modeling are appropriate methods for a new research program that substantiates our complex systems perspective on ideology.",
          "This dissertation explores how competing interests across secondary dimensions of identity shape marginalized groups' capacity to institutionalize their grievances, particularly ethnic minorities. More specifically, I explore two mechanisms, intragroup cohesiveness and distinctiveness, as a driving force of grievance mobilization. This research is interdisciplinary, drawing on theories from political sociology, political communications, and computational social science. I examine the question of ethnic group particization in two stages. In the first stage, I developed an original machine learning pipeline to process large text corpora and identify the indicators of the strength of collective ethnic grievances in online group discussions. In the second stage, I collected a cross-national dataset comprising over 100 ethnic minority groups across 21 post-communist countries to measure their socioeconomic and linguistic cohesiveness and distinctiveness. I find that the two mechanisms, intragroup cohesiveness and distinctiveness, are essential for explaining the mobilization capacity of ethnic minorities to institutionalize their grievances.",

Unlike existing theoretical frameworks that focus on the ideologies of political elites and cadres, this study examines public ideologies in a contentious political manner. Exploiting an AI-based data generation pipeline on digital traces, it distills the eight most prevalent ideologies down to the city level and employs exploratory statistical analyses. Principal Component Analysis delineates two fundamental axes: the traditional left-right political spectrum and a separate spectrum of secular-religious inclination, encompassing both political and cultural dimensions. Then, the Cluster Analysis reveals three distinct groups: left-leaning and religiously inclined, centre-right-leaning and religiously inclined, and those with a centre-right-leaning focus and a pronounced secular orientation. The outcomes provide valuable insights into the political and cultural axes within political society, offering a clearer understanding of the most recent ideological and political climate in Türkiye.",

          "This study aims to explore the online community's perception of the use of machine learning (ML) in dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) through computational text analysis. The use of ML in DDA has become an important area in game design due to its ability to increase engagement and personalize the gaming experience, but it has sparked debate regarding the fairness and transparency of the system. This study uses a descriptive quantitative approach by analyzing 3,016 comments from the Reddit and Steam communities using sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word frequency analysis techniques. The sentiment analysis results show a dominance of positive sentiment (63.8%), followed by negative sentiment (20.9%) and neutral sentiment (15.0%). Topic analysis identified five main themes: Gameplay &amp; Difficulty Adjustment, General Enjoyment &amp; Perception, Narrative Experience &amp; Balance, Combat Mechanics &amp; Fairness, and Technical Reflection &amp; Suggestion. Word frequency analysis showed the community's focus on the balance between challenge (difficulty) and enjoyment (fun) in the gaming experience. The research findings indicate that the online community positively accepts the application of ML in DDA, with the important notes of system transparency, fairness of mechanisms, and balance between technical challenges and players' emotional satisfaction. This research contributes to interdisciplinary studies between game studies, artificial intelligence, and computational social science, and serves as a reference for game developers in designing adaptive systems that are technically effective and accepted by players.",
          "Over the years metascience and the associated Open Science reform movement have garnered extensive criticism. Sometimes such criticism is known as critical metascience (meta-metascience). Moderated by Sven Ulpts (psychology/science studies) and Sheena Bartscherer (social sciences/science studies), in this pre-conference event we would like to provide an open forum for these critical metascience voices by hosting key representatives: Mark Rubin (psychology) will introduce the area of critical metascience and its importance, while Carlos Santana (philosophy of science) will talk about the perils of designing Open Science infrastructures for machine availability and highlight how that can trade off with human epistemic needs. Furthermore, Joseph Bak-Coleman (computational social sciences) will tell us about issues he sees with the replication crisis narrative and Lisa Malich (history of science/ psychology) will talk about the dangers of Metascience's tendencies to homogenize research as well as present potential alternatives. To keep the session dynamic, the audience will be invited to give feedback after each talk. Following this segment we will transition into an open roundtable discussion, to reflect on the kinds of reactions and feedback our panellists have received during the event, but also in the past from the wider metascience community. We will close the event by asking whether these fundamental critiques have had an impact on the culture surrounding metascience, especially concerning reflexivity and how the community engages with criticism.

Like prospectors sifting the sand in a river bed for gold, computational social science researchers are looking into the streams of social media for insight on our social interactions. Enabled by the availability of and easy accessibility to vast amounts of data generated by social entities, as well as by powerful computing hardware and algorithms, its researchers conduct observations of social interaction and experiments testing social theories in scales not realizable before. In this paper, after a short review of the characteristics of this new area, we discuss issues related to the types of data sought and used, and some of the challenges in collecting and interpreting the data. Throughout the paper we also examine some of the pitfalls awaiting and the standards that need to be observed.",
          "Social and cognitive sciences have always faced the choice: either to meet the methodologi- cal standards given by successful natural sciences or to rely on their own. Talking about the conversion of knowledge into technology, the second way did not bring great success. The first way implies two alternative opportunities: reductionism or discovery of proprietary general laws. None of these chances have been realized with any satisfactory results, too. Methodological analysis shows that, to achieve significant progress in social sciences, what is missed there is not new facts or definitions but new conceptual schemes. The reason, as the author supposes, is the nomothetic approach being applied to systems with high degree of complexity and hierarchy. If we assume that social structures and processes are built upon cognitive psychological structures and processes, the former inherit the distributed computational architecture of the latter. The paper analyzes various conceptions of computations in order to determine their relevance to the task of building computational social science. The author offers a “generic” definition of computations as a process carried out by a computational system if the latter is understood as a mechanism of some representation. According to the author, the computationalization of social science implies “naturalization” of computations. This requires a theory that would explain the mechanism of growing complexity and hierarchy of natural (in particular, social) computational systems. As a method for constructing such a science, a kind of reverse engineering is proposed, which is recreation of a computational algorithmic scheme of social tissue by the determination and recombination of “social primitives” – elementary operations of social interaction.",
          "Many social and global challenges in the 21st century, such as climate change, require responses that are rapid and scalable. When centralized decision-making proves insufficient, bottom-up solutions become essential for effective mitigation. The Social Web offers a unique environment for such collec-tive action, as it overcomes geographical boundaries and enables rapid, decentralized, and large-scale<br/>interactions. In this context, communication plays a central role in shaping problem perception, fram-ing issues, and coordinating collective behaviors. Although online platforms make large-scale coor-dination possible, understanding how communication dynamics translate into mobilization remains a challenge.<br/>Existing research on online communication and collective action faces two obstacles: scope and measurement. Much of the existing work is limited in scale, focuses on specific online platforms or collective action issues, or examines only certain stages of mobilization. Furthermore, language use, a core component of online communication, and behaviors associated with collective action are often latent or poorly defined, and the vast amount of textual data produced online complicates their mea-surement at scale. Advances in Natural Language Processing, particularly Large Language Models,<br/>offer new tools for large-scale analysis, but their application to complex and nuanced social concepts remains underexplored.<br/>We address these gaps by examining the relationship between language use and the emergence of collective action behaviors on multiple online platforms (Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, X, and Facebook) and in the context of different collective action problems (climate change, electoral engagement, and labor representation). We tackle the challenge of measuring latent components of this relationship, namely language use and behaviors, by providing both methodological and empirical contributions.<br/>Methodologically, we develop and openly release scalable, theory-driven models to quantify the use of language and behavioral signals. Empirically, we apply these models across platforms and domains to explore how online communicative practices correlate with the emergence of collective action. Our findings advance Computational Social Science and the study of online activism by showing that specific patterns of language use are correlated with collective action behaviors across multiple online domains and issues, addressing gaps in the scope of previous studies. In addition, the opera-tionalization and measurement tools developed in this work can be integrated into analytical pipelines to generate new insights into complex social phenomena at scale. By providing these methodolog-ical and empirical resources, this thesis contributes to building a more systematic understanding of collective action as it unfolds online, supporting future research on social mobilization.",
          "The Panama Papers comprise one of the most recent influential leaks containing detailed information on intermediary companies (such as law firms), offshore entities and company officers, and serve as a valuable source of insight into the operations of (approximately) 214,000 shell companies incorporated in tax havens around the globe over the past half century. Entities and relations in the papers can be used to construct a network that permits, in principle, a systematic and scientific study at scale using techniques developed in the computational social science and network science communities. In this paper, we propose such a study by attempting to quantify and profile the importance of entities. In particular, our research explores whether intermediaries are significantly more influential than offshore entities, and whether different centrality measures lead to varying, or even incompatible, conclusions. Some findings yield conclusions that resemble Simpson’s paradox. We also explore the role that jurisdictions play in determining entity importance.",
          "Social network analysis has proliferated across the social and behavioral sciences, shifting our analytical focus from individuals to the patterns of social ties that connect them. This perspective has enriched our understanding of a great variety of health-related phenomena, including the spread of STDs on contact networks, the spread of health care practices on physicians’ professional networks, the dynamics of patient transfers on networks of clinics, and the spread of weight-related behaviors among adolescents at risk for obesity. The advent of the era of computational social science has augmented the contributions of this perspective, by moving beyond expensive and laborious methods of questionnaires and direct observation to incorporate new techniques of data collection and analysis. For example, these include analysis of electronic health records or other time-stamped communication traces among healthcare practitioners; streams of behavioral data from wearable sensors, location-aware devices, or electronic calendars; automated analysis of text in documents; and mapping networks of interaction by citations and collaboration in clinical research literatures. Whereas much of computational social science has offered new ways of monitoring health behavior and healthcare behavior, or for analyzing those data, a further contribution has been to directly analyze these social processes in system dynamics models, microsimulation, and agent-based models. These approaches allow for computational experiments that assist in predicting and interpreting outcomes from health interventions. This poster will highlight some of my recent and pending work in this domain, aiming to identify potential collaborators in UMCCTS for projects that involve social networks or computational social science.",

          "The subject of the research covers the theoretical and practical foundations of assessing the socio-economic well-being of regions using traditional and innovative approaches. The analysis focuses on identifying the limitations of classical indicators, such as gross regional product, income levels, and demographic characteristics, which do not fully reflect the subjective perception of the quality of life by the population. The study examines international indices (Social Progress Index, Happy Planet Index, World Happiness Report), as well as Russian practices of comprehensive assessment (ratings by RIA Novosti, Expert RA), allowing the identification of their strengths and weaknesses. Additional emphasis is placed on the potential to use digital data and natural language processing methods, including sentiment analysis of texts, to integrate subjective evaluations and public sentiments into the monitoring system. The methodology of the research is based on applying critical analysis methods and comparative reviews of the scientific literature, generalizing the concepts of \"happiness economics\" and integral indices, and employing an interdisciplinary approach that allows for comparing traditional indicators and digital methods of assessing well-being. The scientific novelty lies in the systematization of theoretical schools and indices aimed at measuring well-being, justifying the need for integrating subjective digital indicators into traditional monitoring models of socio-economic development of regions. The novelty is also manifested in emphasizing the application of computational social science methods, including automated text analysis, as a promising direction to enhance the sensitivity and timeliness of monitoring. The proposed approach expands existing practices, allowing not only to capture objective indicators but also to consider the dynamics of public sentiments, which changes the system of assessing well-being towards greater completeness and comprehensiveness. Conclusions: classical indicators (GRP, income) reflect the standard of living in a limited manner, while international and Russian ratings, despite their complexity, remain static and lag behind in time. The use of digital indicators for social scoring enables the formation of more timely and representative monitoring. They combine economic, sociological, and digital approaches, providing more accurate diagnostics of regional development and creating a tool to support strategic decisions in regional policy.",
          "ABSTRACT In this project, we semantically enriched and enhanced the metadata of long text documents, theses and dissertations, retrieved from the HathiTrust Digital Library in English published from 1920 to 2020 through a combination of manual efforts and large language models. This dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing research in areas such as computational social science, digital humanities, and information science. Our paper shows that enriching metadata using LLMs is particularly beneficial for digital repositories by introducing additional metadata access points that may not have originally been foreseen to accommodate various content types. This approach is particularly effective for repositories that have significant missing data in their existing metadata fields, enhancing search results, and improving the accessibility of the digital repository.",
          "Over the past decade, an explosion in the availability of education-related datasets has enabled new computational research in education. Much of this work has investigated digital traces of online learners in order to better understand and optimize their cognitive learning processes. Yet cognitive learning on digital platforms does not equal education. Instead, education is an inherently social, cultural, economic, and political process manifesting in physical spaces, and educational outcomes are influenced by many factors that precede and shape the cognitive learning process. Many of these are social factors like children's connections to schools (including teachers, counselors, and role models), parents and families, and the broader neighborhoods in which they live. In this article, we briefly discuss recent studies of learning through large-scale digital platforms, but largely focus on those exploring sociological aspects of education. We believe computational social scientists can creatively advance this emerging research frontier-and in doing so, help facilitate more equitable educational and life outcomes.",

          "Supervised machine learning has become an increasingly valuable methodological tool for computational social scientists, enabling researchers to discover novel, complex patterns in data and to make predictions for new observations. In this chapter, we introduce two fundamental problems in supervised machine learning – classification and regression, where categorical and quantitative responses, respectively, are predicted from a set of input variables. Using illustrative examples from social science, we explain the supervised machine learning process beginning with data collection and processing through fitting a model and ultimately evaluating the model's performance. We also describe and contrast several fundamental types of supervised machine learning models, including classical linear models, k-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes models, decision trees, artificial neural networks, deep learning models, and ensemble methods. These methods represent both classically studied approaches and emerging trends from the machine learning literature with great potential for computational social science. We conclude by highlighting the strengths of both the various approaches and popular software resources for utilizing and applying these valuable tools.",
          "Digital text has revolutionized how we consume and produce information, and also provides seemingly limitless sources of data from Twitter feeds to online historical archives. Such new data challenge traditional boundaries between quantitative and qualitative research, and exciting horizons have emerged. New analytic approaches are warranted, however, given the typically unstructured, respondent-generated format of such data. In this article, I examine how sociologists have handled text data prior to digitization. Building on recent advancements in computational linguistics and computational social science, I then offer a network-based model and approach for analyzing similarities and locating emergent, general themes in digitized text. I provide a case in point by analyzing the United States’ presidential inaugural addresses. This analysis illustrates how sociologists can take advantage of both the breadth of new digital sources of data and the richness that such qualitative material provides. Indeed, the digitization of texts represents a possible and stimulating sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories. The greatest potential in these regards rests at the nexus of new computational methods and in-depth, qualitative strategies.",

          "Disaster events and their economic impacts are trending, and climate projection studies suggest that the risks of disaster will continue to increase in the near future. Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments.",
          "Since its articulation in 2009, Computational Social Science (CSS) has grown into a mature interdisciplinary paradigm, shaped first by mobile media-generated digital traces and more recently by generative AI. With over a decade of development, CSS has expanded its scope across data, methods, and theory: data sources have evolved from mobile traces to multimodal records; methods have diversified from surveys and experiments to agent-based modeling, network analysis, and computer vision; and theory has advanced by revisiting classical questions and modeling emergent digital phenomena. Generative AI further enhances CSS through scalable annotation, experimental design, and simulation, while raising challenges of validity, reproducibility, and ethics. The evolutionary logic of CSS lies in coupling theory, models, and data, balancing innovation with normative safeguards to build cumulative knowledge and support responsible digital governance.",
          "Grand societal issues such as climate change and technological disruption challenge all industry sectors, including tourism. To cope with these challenges, new sustainable business models that not only rely on data-driven technologies but also require new ways of collaboration beyond disciplines and sectors by facilitating the overall conception of transdisciplinarity are essential. One potential way to combine all these requirements is computational social sciences. As a discipline-crossing approach, it should be anchored within tourism education to train the future workforce and experts necessary to realize the needed transformation. Thus, this study explores the status quo of tourism curricula in higher educational institutions in Austria through the lens of computational social sciences. In doing so, a set of core modules of computational social sciences content was developed as an analytical framework. The results show that there is still a significant gap between the demands of the tourism industry and the offered educational programs in Austria. The article concludes with insights on how to close the existing gap and some suggestions for possible foundational steps to support the transformation.",
          "<title>Abstract</title> To improve climate communication, it is crucial to understand how different audiences respond to pro-climate messages, particularly in information environments where accurate information competes with climate-contrarian disinformation. Here, we analyze responses to real-world climate change information and their downstream consequences for climate change concern and information search behavior. Using computational social science techniques, we gathered a diverse set of real-world pro-climate messages from the social media platform Twitter/X. These pro-climate messages were evaluated on several dimensions by a representative sample of the UK population ( <italic>N</italic> = 503). Message evaluations from conservative and liberal participants showed substantial covariation, pointing to an overall consensus on the ranking of the persuasive and informative qualities of the messages. Specification curve analysis, in addition, revealed robust main effects on individual differences on message evaluation. Coupling the data with results from a large cross-cultural experiment ( <italic>N</italic> = 2,226), showed that collective message evaluations shared strong commonalities across nations. These evaluations, in turn, predicted shifts in climate concern and climate information search behavior, with more positively evaluated messages decreasing the likelihood of subsequent engagement with climate-contrarian disinformation. Alongside the empirical data, we release the <italic>ClimateChirp</italic> database containing validated pro-climate stimuli for future climate communication research. Despite individual differences in responses to climate communication, we found an overall consensus on aggregate ratings across audience groups, which were associated with shifts in concern and behavior after message exposure.",
          "Academic performance is a key component in the development and subsequent empowerment of youth. It is affected by a large number of different factors, such as inherent ability and socioeconomic circumstance, which can vary widely amongst different individuals. In particular, children from disadvantaged families face unique challenges that do not occur in normal families. We analyze the Fragile Families Challenge (FFC) dataset using data science algorithms, and study the relationship between the features reported and GPA scores. We grouped GPA scores into three groups (top, middle and low) and used a random forest classifier to predict the GPA class for each subject. Then, we used a recently developed algorithm---Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)---to cluster subjects into subgroups based on the factors affecting each individual. We further analyzed the clusters to elucidate the differences occurring within different subgroups in the community of disadvantaged individuals and figure out which set of features matter for each subgroup. Conventional studies seek factors which apply to all members of a population, and often overlook the unique needs of individuals with different backgrounds and characteristics or divide individuals into predetermined subgroups and study which factors affect each subgroup. The approach used here can find correlations which are specific to individual subjects, and can inform the formulation of targeted and effective intervention strategies. Our study contributes to the field of social science by highlighting the differences of indicators of academic performance in different subgroups. Also, our novel data science pipeline contributes to the fields of data science and computational social science.",
          "Abstract We propose a framework integrating insights from computational social science, political, and social psychology to explain how extreme polarization can occur in deeply divided societies. Extreme polarization in a society emerges through a dynamic and complex process where societal, group, and individual factors interact. Dissent at different levels of analysis represents the driver of this process, where societal-level ideological dissent divides society into opposing camps, each with contrasting collective narratives. Within these opposing camps, further dissent leads to the formation of splinter factions and radical cells—sub-groups with increasingly extreme views. At the group level, collective narratives underpinning group identity become more extreme as society fragments. At the individual level, this process involves the internalization of an extreme group narrative and norms sanctioning radical behavior. The intense bonding within these groups and the convergence of personal and group identities through identity fusion increase the likelihood of radical group behavior.",
          "Living intangible heritage has increasingly become a focal point of research within cultural studies, anthropology, and computational social science, owing to its dynamic evolution across communities under globalization, digitalization, and rapid demographic change. Unlike tangible heritage that is grounded in physical artifacts, living intangible heritage persists only through enactment, apprenticeship, and intergenerational transfer. This study investigates the semantic mapping and causal identification of cross-community diffusion in living intangible heritage, focusing on twenty-four communities in East Asia and Europe from 2000 to 2024. A dataset of 1.27 million text and oral records was compiled, encompassing UNESCO nomination files, festival documentation, apprenticeship contracts, oral histories, and digital heritage repositories. A transformer-based embedding model was used to generate semantic maps at five-year intervals, capturing the evolution of vocabulary and meanings across communities. Causal identification was conducted using a structural causal model, inverse probability weighting, and bootstrapped replications to disentangle exogenous drivers from endogenous reinforcement. Results indicate a decline in semantic modularity from 0.62 to 0.51 and a rise in cross-community semantic similarity from 0.38 to 0.47, with martial arts exhibiting the strongest diffusion and artisanal crafts the weakest. Regression analysis showed that government funding ( = 0.214, p &lt; 0.01), demographic overlap ( = 0.287, p &lt; 0.01), and eigenvector centrality ( = 0.193, p &lt; 0.05) significantly predicted diffusion strength. Validation through placebo treatments and sensitivity analysis confirmed robustness. These findings highlight both the methodological contributions of integrating semantic mapping and causal inference, and the policy implications of fostering targeted interventions that enhance the sustainability of intangible heritage across interconnected cultural ecosystems.",
          "Researchers across disciplines have begun to discuss the potential errors that can occur when digital traces, such as social media data, are used to learn about humans and social phenomena. This chapter will give concrete application examples of computational social science research with social media data.

          "Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs—often called misinformation or disinformation—through a population has never seemed so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual’s set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation and “alternative facts.”",
          "In recent years, several high-profile political protests and social movements have formed on and through social media. Whereas most large-scale datasets address singular social media movements political topical discussions, or events, Tweets Across the Political Spectrum 2016–2020 (TAPS) instead provides access to social media data on a broad range of digital political issues and social movements, spanning over several years. The TAPS dataset incorporates data based on a range of high-profile and widely used hashtags, ranging from those on the far left of the political spectrum to those on the far right. Concretely, we introduce a dataset consisting of 207 million tweets, posted between 2016-01-01 and 2020-12-31, using any of the 24 hashtags #alllivesmatter, #antifa, #black- livesmatter, #blackouttuesday, #blm, #bluelivesmatter, #deepstate, #extinctionrebellion, #fridaysforfuture, #greennewdeal, #maga, #marchforourlives, #metoo, #nobannowall, #nodapl, #pizzagate, #qanon, #qarmy, #takeaknee, #unitetheright, #whitegenocide, #whitelivesmatter, #womensmarch, and #wwg1wga. TAPS is relevant for research into political debates, social movements, polarisation and more, within a range of academic fields, including for instance computational social science, sociology, political science, data science, and communication studies. The data span over an extended period during which these hashtags were frequently used, and the dataset is comprehensive enough to identify large-scale patterns and to provide possibili- ties for comparisons over time, within or across political issues. To our knowledge this is the only large-scale dataset which incorporates, to this degree, tweets from different social movements, political discussions, and protests on different ends of the political spectrum.",

At the national level, high employment is one of the central goals of\\nany economic policy, due to its close association with national prosperity. The\\nmain goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into\\naccount the complex structure of labor market interactions. In particular, we\\nexplore the benefits of leveraging tools from computational social science,\\nnetwork science, and data-driven theories to measure the flow of opportunities\\nand information in the context of the labor market. First, we investigate our\\nkey hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties,\\nand this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the\\nidea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities,\\nwhere we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher\\nthan within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within\\nrelated activities there are more \"capitals\" involved and that such activities\\nrequire similar \"capabilities.\" Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic\\nactivities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow\\nof opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow\\nusing a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).\\n",
          "Often we hear that human beings are social creatures who interact with one another. In organizations, employees communicate with one another using both formal and informal networks, but top management are unable to observe and manage these networks. This chapter addresses how social network analysis theory and computational social science can be combined to visualize and map out the relationship structures. The chapter seeks to address how the theory, which is commonly associated with mathematics and sociology disciplines can be used in communication since the research is hardly visible. It breaks down some aspects of the theory and describes another two theories that have developed from it. Finally, for illustration, the chapter applied R Studio software to compute the social structures within a media organization and help realize the benefit of theory in knowledge sharing and employee synergy.",
          "The main aim of this article is to emphasize the significance of adopting an interdisciplinary approach when researching contemporary social phenomena. It identifies the shortcomings of traditional sociology, which frequently lacks the digital tools to effectively analyse these phenomena, and contrasts them with engineering approaches that frequently employ computer science methods. This article advocates for a combination of these disciplines, which not only promotes the development of innovative methods but also contributes to the emergence of sub-disciplines such as Digital Sociology, Computational Social Science, and Digital Social Science. The argument presented is grounded in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), which provides a robust framework for understanding the dynamic interplay between society and technology, acknowledging both human and non-human entities as active participants in social networks. This approach challenges traditional perspectives and encourages a comprehensive reassessment of social interactions and technological impacts.",
          "Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.",

          "The crisis of finance capitalism, accelerating climate change, near civil war in Pakistan - all of these recent events illustrate how poorly political science conceptualizes and models change and complexity in politics. Each also illustrates the increasingly problematic dichotomy between domestic and politics, and questions the tenability of the traditional levels of analysis that form the foundation of international relations theory. This paper argues that the levels of analysis popularized by Waltz's Man, the State, and War are responsible for IR theory’s inability to conceptualize change and complexity in international relations. By reifying distinctions between the individual, society, the state, and the international system, traditional levels of analysis are particularly prone to the ecological fallacy on the one hand, and fallacies of composition on the other. The paper advocates a different paradigm to understand change - that of computational social science. In contrast to theories of international relations that emphasize structures and equilibria, this interdisciplinary approach to understanding dynamic systems emphasizes relational ontologies and processes within systems. Complex systems theory's concept of emergence illuminates how small, substate-level actors can initiate change at the systemic level, while structural perturbations may initiate radical changes in state-level politics. Together with ideas from network theory and evolutionary game theory, complex systems theory can inform our understanding of the intricacies of and change in politics as diverse as interstate negotiations, global trade, political campaigns, and climate change. This illustrates the potential of computational social science to inform future political science scholarship and policy-making.",

          "Has the emerging field of computational social science grown increasingly intellectually integrated with the passage of time, or does the field remain fragmented into several distinct epistemic communities? Because research-based literature is still inconclusive in this regard, the authors exploited scientific-citations and co-citation data to study the development of computational social science's intellectual structure. The findings suggest that network science has maintained centrality over the years. Contrary to common perceptions however, the field has not become more integrated over time. Rather, the network of co-citation among the field's key authors exhibits ever more extensive clustering and greater average path length over 2000-2020, indicating that the discipline is fracturing into various sub-communities, with loose connections to each other.",

Krakauer, John Gaddis, and Kenneth Pomeranz. What is history anyway? Most people would say it is what happened in the past, but how far back does the past extend? To the first written sources? To what other forms of evidence reveal about preliterate civilizations? What does that term mean—an empire, a nation, a city, a village, a family, and a lonely hermit somewhere? Why stop with people: history also should not comprise the environment in which they exist, and if so on what scale and how far back?

We estimated the world's technological capacity to store, communicate, and compute information, tracking 60 analog and digital technologies during the period from 1986 to 2007. In 2007, humankind was able to store 2.9 × 1020 optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 × 1021 bytes, and carry out 6.4 × 1018 instructions per second on general-purpose computers. General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58%. The world's capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23%).

The following news item is taken in part from the February, 2011 issue of SFI Working Papers titled “The Evolution and Structure of Sustainability Science,” by Luis M.A. Bettencourt and Jasleen Kaur. The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields as diverse as ecology, the social sciences and engineering.

We study information processing in populations of Boolean networks with evolving connectivity and systematically explore the interplay between the learning capability, robustness, the network topology, and the task complexity. We solve a long-standing open question and find computationally that, for large system sizes N, adaptive information processing drives the networks to a critical connectivity Kc = 2. For finite size networks, the connectivity approaches the critical value with a power-law of the system size N. (…) A link to this article can be found at http://arXiv.org/abs/1104.4141.

Rockmore. The World Trade Web (WTW) is a weighted network, whose nodes correspond to countries with edge weights reflecting the value of imports and/or exports between countries. In this paper, we introduce to this macroeconomic system the notion of extinction analysis, a technique often used in the analysis of ecosystems, for the purposes of investigating the robustness of this network. In particular, we subject the WTW to a principled set of in silico \"knockout experiments,\" akin to those carried out in the investigation of food webs, but suitably adapted to this macroeconomic network. Broadly, our experiments show that over time the WTW moves to a \"robust yet fragile\" configuration, where it is robust under random attacks but fragile under targeted attack.

Many questions about present-day interaction networks could be answered by tracking how the network changed over time.

The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems toward a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here, we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes. A link to this article can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10011.

Correlations of activity in such networks are of interest in a variety of fields, from gene-regulatory networks to neuroscience.

The following news item is taken in part from the May 13, 2011 issue of arXiv titled “The Implications of Interactions for Science and Philosophy,” by Carlos Gershenson. Reductionism has dominated science and philosophy for centuries. Complexity has recently shown that interactions, which reductionism neglects, are relevant for understanding phenomena. When interactions are considered, reductionism becomes limited in several aspects. In this paper, I argue that interactions imply nonreductionism, nonmaterialism, nonpredictability, non-Platonism, and nonnihilism. As alternatives to each of these, holism, informism, adaptation, contextuality, and meaningfulness are put forward, respectively. A worldview that includes interactions not only describes better our world but also can help to solve many open scientific, philosophical, and social problems caused by implications of reductionism.

The following news item is taken in part from the May 20, 2011 issue of PLoS ONE titled “Time-Ordered Networks Reveal Limitations to Information Flow in Ant Colonies,” by Benjamin Blonder and Anna Dornhaus. Using thousands of time-stamped interactions between uniquely marked ants in four colonies of a range of sizes, we demonstrate that observed maximum rates of information flow are always slower than predicted and are constrained by regulation of individual mobility and contact rate. By accounting for the ordering and timing of interactions, we can resolve important difficulties with network sampling frequency and duration, enabling a broader understanding of interaction network functioning across systems and scales.

When selecting a resource to exploit, an insect colony must take into account at least two constraints (…) Following recent results on cockroaches and ants, we introduce here a behavioral mechanism that satisfies these two constraints. Individuals simply modulate their probability to switch to another resource as a function of the local density of conspecifics locally detected. As a result, the individuals gather at the smallest resource that can host the whole group. A link to this article can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019888. The following news item is taken in part from the May 13, 2011 issue of arXiv titled “Growth and Optimality in Network Evolution,” by Markus Brede. In this paper, we investigate networks, whose evolution is governed by the interaction of a random assembly process and an optimization process. In the first process, new nodes are added one at a time and form connections to randomly selected old nodes. In between node additions, the network is rewired to minimize its pathlength. For timescales, at which neither the assembly nor the optimization processes are dominant, we find a rich variety of complex networks with power-law tails in the degree distributions. These networks also exhibit nontrivial clustering, a hierarchical organization, and interesting degree mixing patterns. A link to this article can be found at http://arXiv.org/abs/1105.2614.

Cyber-rumor and cybergossip are some of these highly relevant risks in the study of cyberbehavior, as they modulate emotional and attitudinal processes that can negatively affect psychological well-being, as well as the immediate social context. This document presents a general review and a reflection on the progress in the theoretical body of cybergossip. It defines the construct in comparison with cyber-rumor and cyberbullying, presents a study carried out in Colombia from a cross-cultural perspective and offers possible future lines of work from computational social sciences.

          "This white paper introduces the Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE), a systems-engineering framework designed to simulate the evolution of complex civilizations. By treating narrative not as a scripted story, but as an emergent property of legal, economic, and ontological systems, the SOE framework transforms \"world-building\" into a rigorous discipline of Civilization Modeling. While the core architecture is genre-agnostic, this paper demonstrates its application through the lens of a new design-fiction school: Speculative Procedural Ontopunk (SPO). Reference ImplementationsThis framework is currently operational in two distinct genres: Sci-Fi (SPO): The Codex Totalis (The Caldwell Legacy) Fantasy (Magocracy): The Codex Octavis (The Octavian Archives) Review the SOE Framework in Notebook LM: [LINK] Abstract This paper introduces the Speculative Ontological Engine (SOE), a rigorous and extensible framework for civilization-modeling that treats narrative as an emergent, verifiable output of a complex system. We propose an alternative methodological framework for narrative construction, moving from traditional \"world-building\" to a disciplined form of civilization-modeling grounded in systems theory. While the reference implementation focuses on a school of design-fiction we term Speculative Procedural Ontopunk (SPO), the underlying architecture is genre-agnostic. The framework prioritizes the administrative, legal, and ontological protocols of a civilization as the primary drivers of conflict. The core of the SOE is a recursive causal algorithm, the Antivalent Cycle, which models historical progression as a series of codified systemic responses to emergent crises. This process is governed by the Antivalent Design Principle, grounded in theories of complex systems. We detail the MODEL Framework’s four-component architecture—the Kernel, the Variable, the Cycle, and the CORE—and utilize the THREAD Axioms to constrain the logic of the reference simulation. The result is a transparent, repeatable engine for architecting \"Societal Flight Simulators,\" reframing narrative creation as a disciplined form of speculative social modeling analogous to computational social science. The canonical instantiation of this framework is the Codex Totalis.

          "The advent of Big Data has shifted social science research towards computational methods. The volume of data that is nowadays available has brought a radical change in traditional approaches due to the cost and effort needed for processing. Knowledge extraction from heterogeneous and ample data is not an easy task to tackle. Thus, interdisciplinary approaches are necessary, combining experts of both social and computer science. This paper aims to present a work in the context of protest analysis, which falls into the scope of Computational Social Science. More specifically, the contribution of this work is to describe a Computational Social Science methodology for Event Analysis. The presented methodology is generic in the sense that it can be applied in every event typology and moreover, it is innovative and suitable for interdisciplinary tasks as it incorporates the human-in-the-loop. Additionally, a case study is presented concerning Protest Analysis in Greece over the last two decades.

          "Museum collection strategies are governed by a variety of factors, including topical focus, acquisition funds, availability of works in the art market, donations and specific coincidental opportunities. Yet, it remains unclear if more fundamental collection patterns emerge, exist, and are shared between museums, which could for example allow an established artist to estimate when a contemporary art museum would acquire their works. Here we collect and analyze data from 12 European contemporary art museums, taking into account artwork creation dates, collection acquisition dates, and the associated artist age at both points in time. From this simple quantitative construct we are able to reveal a striking gradient of museum profiles at the aggregate level. This lag can function to constitute a macroeconomic index of \"mean museum collection lag\", ranging from 3 years in the most dynamic cases (Kiasma) to 33 years in the most established institutions (Reina Sofia). Meanwhile, on the granular level, plotting artist age over collection year, and using artist-age vs artwork-collection matrices, a detailed picture becomes evident, where individual museums are characterized by shared patterns and a rich heterogeneity of ideographic details. Regularities include continuous acquisitions, systematic acquisition of older materials over time, and brief bursts, where whole oeuvres of individual artists join specific collections. Hence, we are able to shed light on the detailed collection history of museums, transcending the anecdotal nature of art historical storytelling via the provision of a quantitative context. Our approach of cultural data analysis combines expertise in art, art history, computational social science, and computer science. Our joint perspective builds a bridge between and serves an audience of museum professionals, art market actors, collectors, and individual artists alike.",

          "Groundwater depletion is arguably one of humanity’s greatest sustainability challenges of the 21st century. With Sustainable Development Goals only a decade away, water authorities around the world are in the urgent need for concrete and targeted measures to ensure that communities adhere to groundwater management policies as rapidly and as effectively as possible. In this paper, we combine computational social science, groundwater modelling and empirical data from the World Values Survey to generate future ensembles of hydro-social trajectories under alternative courses of management and social action or inaction. Our simulations shed new light on the role that cultural values can play in shaping the societal trajectories and norms that emerge when resources are either allocated or not sufficiently allocated to monitor compliance, issue fines, engage community leaders, and deter rule-breakers. This study presents a new approach to explore and evaluate the capacity of existing and future management actions to steer groundwater systems towards sustainable trajectories, to forecast the celerity and timing of social transformations at the inter-decadal scale, and to help nations identify the most pertinent management options under institutional, political, social, and/or cultural constraints.

However, current research on program design and evaluation tends to focus on determining causality through complex statistical methods, neglecting intermediate measures of data, such as network metrics. Similarly, research in computational social science has focused on generating hypotheses and validating theory rather than economic development applications. This thesis develops a novel technique for using computational social science to design and evaluate social and economic programs. A framework for program design and evaluation using network metrics is presented, along with two case studies that illustrate the use of this technique. In the first, we consider Start-Up Chile, an economic development program whose goal is to foster networks between Chileans and international entrepreneurs, using network metrics to evaluate its ability to facilitate connection between Chilean and non- Chilean entrepreneurs. Second, an agent-based model for designing entrepreneurial incubators is developed, with novel conclusions for more efficient design of economic development programs.",
          "Disaster events and their economic impacts are trending, and climate projection studies suggest that the risks of disaster will continue to increase in the near future. Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments.",
          "Today’s world allows people to connect over larger distances and in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.",

          "Exposure to information sources of different types and modalities, such as social media, movies, scholarly reports, and interactions with other communities and groups can change a person's values as well as their knowledge and attitude towards various social phenomena. My doctoral research aims to analyze the effect of these stimuli on people and groups by applying mixed-method approaches that include techniques from natural language processing, close reading, and machine learning. The research leverages different types of user-generated texts (i.e., social media and customer reviews), and professionally-generated texts (i.e., scholarly publications and organizational documents) to study (1) the impact of information that aims to advance social good for individuals and society, and (2) the impact of social and individual biases on people's language use. This work contributes to advancing knowledge, theory and computational solutions relevant to the field of computational social science. The approaches and insights discussed can provide a better understanding of people's attitudes and judgments toward issues and events of general interest, which is necessary to develop solutions for minimizing biases, filter bubbles, and polarization while also improving the effectiveness of interpersonal and societal discourse.",
          "This article discusses the emergence of a computational social science analytics fusion as a mainstream scientific approach involving machine-based methods and explanatory empiricism as a basis for the discovery of new policy-related insights for business, consumer and social settings. It reflects the interdisciplinary background of the new approaches that the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science has embraced over the years, and especially some of the recent development and shifts in the scientific study of technology-related phenomena. It also has evoked new forms of research inquiry, blended approaches to research methodology, and more pointed interest in the production of research results that have direct application in various industry contexts.

          "Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. There is a dearth of large annotated training datasets in the multimedia domain hindering the development of supervised learning models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. On the other hand, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question-answering, and topic classification. To leverage such advanced techniques to bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing long videos to generate their descriptions in natural language, followed by performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on fifteen video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised baselines for video understanding. Furthermore, to alleviate a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science on persuasion strategy identification.",
          "A major challenge in Computational Social Science consists in modelling and explaining the temporal dynamics of human communication. Understanding small group interactions can help shed light on sociological and social psychological questions relating to human communications. Previous work showed how Markov rewards models can be used to analyse group interaction in meeting. We explore further the potential of these models by formulating queries over interaction as probabilistic temporal logic properties and analysing them with probabilistic model checking. For this study, we analyse a dataset taken from a standard corpus of scenario and non-scenario meetings and demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach to validate expected interactions and identify patterns of interest.",
          "Abstract Similarly to other domains of the social sciences, behavioural science has grappled with a crisis concerning the effect sizes of research findings. Different solutions have been provided to answer this challenge. This paper will discuss analytical strategies developed in the context of computational social science, namely causal tree and forest, that will benefit behavioural scientists in harnessing heterogeneity of treatment effects in RCTs. As a mixture of theoretical and data-driven approaches, these techniques are well suited to exploit the rich information provided by large studies conducted using RCTs. We discuss the characteristics of these methods and their methodological rationale and provide simulations to illustrate their use. We simulate two scenarios of RCTs-generated data and explore the heterogeneity of treatment effects using causal tree and causal forest methods. Furthermore, we outlined a potential theoretical use of these techniques to enrich behavioural science ecological validity by introducing the notion of behavioural niche.",

          "This paper argues that the basic premise of Social Network Analysis (SNA) -- namely that social reality is constituted by dyadic relations and that social interactions are determined by structural properties of networks-- is neither necessary nor sufficient, for Big Social Data analytics of Facebook or Twitter data. However, there exist no other holistic computational social science approach beyond the relational sociology and graph theory of SNA. To address this limitation, this paper presents an alternative holistic approach to Big Social Data analytics called Social Set Analysis (SSA). Based on the sociology of associations and the mathematics of classical, fuzzy and rough set theories, this paper proposes a research program. The function of which is to design, develop and evaluate social set analytics in terms of fundamentally novel formal models, predictive methods and visual analytics tools for Big Social Data. Four demonstrative case studies, employing SSA, covering the range of descriptive, predictive, visual and prescriptive analytics are presented and briefly discussed.",

In the latest years, statistical offices have made efforts to profit from harnessing the potential offered by these new sources of data, with promising results. But how difficult is this integration process? What are the challenges that statistical offices would likely face to profit from new data sources and analytical methods? This chapter will start by setting the scene of the current official statistics system, with a focus on its fundamental principles and dimensions relevant to the use of non-traditional data. It will then present some experiments and proofs of concept in the context of data innovation for official statistics, followed by a discussion on prospective challenges related to sustainable data access, new technical and methodological approaches and effective use of new sources of data.",

It is shown that digital trace represents a multimodal array of data on communicative, cooperative, consumer, and judicial practices mediated by digital infrastructures. The need for a transition from descriptive accounting of isolated events to the construction of a system of integral and composite indicators reflecting the dynamic, structural, semantic, and temporal characteristics of social activity is substantiated. Particular intellectual attention is given to effective methods for measuring trace levels: network analysis, probabilistic modeling, thematic and semantic text analysis, index constructions, and neural network algorithms that provide hidden behavioral patterns.",
          "Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) play a crucial role in shaping public discourse and societal norms. This study examines the term Sessiz Istila (Silent Invasion) on Turkish social media, highlighting the rise of anti-refugee sentiment amidst the Syrian refugee influx. Using BERTurk and the TREMO dataset, we developed an advanced Emotion Recognition Model (ERM) tailored for Turkish, achieving 92.62% accuracy in categorizing emotions such as happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise. By applying this model to large-scale X data, the study uncovers emotional nuances in Turkish discourse, contributing to computational social science by advancing sentiment analysis in underrepresented languages and enhancing our understanding of global digital discourse and the unique linguistic challenges of Turkish. The findings underscore the transformative potential of localized NLP tools, with our ERM model offering practical applications for real-time sentiment analysis in Turkish-language contexts. By addressing critical areas, including marketing, public relations, and crisis management, these models facilitate improved decision-making through timely and accurate sentiment tracking. This highlights the significance of advancing research that accounts for regional and linguistic nuances.",
          "Online forums provide rich environments where users may post questions and comments about different topics. Understanding how people behave in online forums may shed light on the fundamental mechanisms by which collective thinking emerges in a group of individuals, but it has also important practical applications, for instance to improve user experience, increase engagement or automatically identify bullying. Importantly, the datasets generated by the activity of the users are often openly available for researchers, in contrast to other sources of data in computational social science. In this survey, we map the main research directions that arose in recent years and focus primarily on the most popular platform, Reddit. We distinguish and categorise research depending on their focus on the posts or on the users, and point to different types of methodologies to extract information from the structure and dynamics of the system. We emphasize the diversity and richness of the research in terms of questions and methods, and suggest future avenues of research.",
          "This research explores how social interactions in educational settings influence academic outcomes, cooperation, and group dynamics in primary school classrooms. By applying methods from Computational Social Sciences and Complex Systems, this work integrates three key approaches: network science to measure social structure and student positioning, the collection of behavioral data through field experiments based on game theory applied in the classroom, and econometric analysis to approximate causal effects. The first study examines how reciprocity in social relationships within the classroom enhances academic performance, showing that students who engage in reciprocal interactions achieve better results. The second study investigates how friendship modulates hierarchical relations in public schools, finding that cooperation dynamics among peers are strongly influenced by social status, but friendships can mitigate these hierarchies. The third study focuses on the social interactions of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) within classrooms that incorporate both students with and without special educational needs, showing that these students tend to occupy peripheral positions in social networks and engage less frequently in reciprocal relationships. The findings of this project provide a deeper understanding of social relationships in educational contexts, with significant implications for managing classroom dynamics and designing educational policies aimed at improving school coexistence and social inclusion.",

          "&lt;p&gt;Transition modelling is an emerging but growing niche within the broader field of sustainability transitions research. The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of this niche in relation to a range of existing modelling approaches and literatures with which it shares commonalities or from which it could draw. We distil a number of key aspects we think a transitions model should be able to address, from a broadly acknowledged, empirical list of transition characteristics. We review some of the main strands in modelling of socio-technological change with regards to their ability to address these characteristics. These are: Eco-innovation literatures (energy-economy models and Integrated Assessment Models), evolutionary economics, complex systems models, computational social science simulations using agent based models, system dynamics models and socio-ecological systems models. The modelling approaches reviewed can address many of the features that differentiate sustainability transitions from other socio-economic dynamics or innovations. The most problematic features are the representation of qualitatively different system states and of the normative aspects of change. The comparison provides transition researchers with a starting point for their choice of a modelling approach, whose characteristics should correspond to the characteristics of the research question they face. A promising line of research is to develop innovative models of co-evolution of behaviours and technologies towards sustainability, involving change in the structure of the societal and technical systems.&lt;/p&gt;",

          "Understanding why electric vehicle (EV) adoption in the United States exhibits persistent state-level disparities despite widespread policy support is a pressing research and policy challenge, as resolving this unevenness is essential to accelerating localized adoption and advancing a more equitable national transition toward electric mobility. While emerging research has begun to explore these heterogeneities, most studies overlook the mediating mechanism of public perception in connecting structural predictors with consumer behavior, a factor that has been demonstrated to be critical. Compounding this theoretical gap, existing work primarily relies on survey-based methods, which are costly, labor-intensive, and difficult to replicate or scale across time and geography. To address these limitations, this dissertation develops an integrated framework that quantifies and models the perceptual bridge by fusing large-scale geotagged social media data with state-level numerical indicators.The research unfolds across three interconnected studies. The first establishes a robust foundation for measuring public sentiment toward EVs. By developing a Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data labeling workflow and a geometry-preserving oversampling method, this study achieves high-accuracy sentiment classification by effectively addressing the challenges of annotation quality and class imbalance in high-dimensional text embeddings. The results reveal a paradoxical trend: although EV registrations increased nationwide from 2019 to 2022, public satisfaction with EVs and their market declined sharply. This sentiment-adoption divergence indicates that aggregate measures of social acceptance are insufficient for interpreting market growth, as underlying perceptual patterns evolve along distinct thematic and spatial dimensions that require a finer-resolution analysis.To investigate these discrepancies, the second study introduces a five-stage topic modeling framework that transforms unstructured tweets into granular thematic channels by leveraging the information-distillation capability of LLMs. The analysis identifies eight dominant public discourse topics and uncovers a temporal shift from early optimism about performance and environmental benefits toward more pragmatic concerns. This thematic transition clarifies the paradox observed earlier: the national decline in overall positivity does not imply uniform negativity across all topics but rather reflects a redistribution of public attention toward themes with inherently lower baseline positivity.The third study estimates the micro-level effects of external shifts on EV adoption through their corresponding perceptual pathways by integrating text-derived sentiment indicators into a time-lagged panel Structural Equation Model. The model combines a Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Model with Mundlak decomposition to disentangle within-state from cross-state effects while accounting for data uncertainty, with an Arellano-Bond Generalized Method of Moments estimator to correct for Nickell bias from the short time series. The results reveal that sentiments related to economic considerations, charging accessibility, and grid reliability are the most influential mediators linking policies to adoption outcomes. Additionally, the findings show that structural predictors present varying effects on within-state versus cross-state adoption dynamics.These studies collectively establish a reproducible data-fusion framework that integrates computational social science with econometric modeling to explain the perceptual mechanisms shaping the process of passenger transportation electrification. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders by identifying the specific structural and perceptual levers that most effectively accelerate EV adoption and advance a more equitable transition. They offer tailored guidance for state and federal agencies on how to prioritize policy interventions and allocate resources strategically to meet evolving goals over time.",
          "Current analytical approaches in computational social science can be characterized by four dominant paradigms: text analysis (information extraction and classification), social network analysis (graph theory), social complexity analysis (complex systems science), and social simulations (cellular automata and agent-based modeling). However, when it comes to organizational and societal units of analysis, there exists no approach to conceptualize, model, analyze, explain, and predict social media interactions as individuals' associations with ideas, values, identities, and so on. To address this limitation, based on the sociology of associations and the mathematics of set theory, this paper presents a new approach to big data analytics called social set analysis. Social set analysis consists of a generative framework for the philosophies of computational social science, theory of social data, conceptual and formal models of social data, and an analytical framework for combining big social data sets with organizational and societal data sets. Three empirical studies of big social data are presented to illustrate and demonstrate social set analysis in terms of fuzzy set-theoretical sentiment analysis, crisp set-theoretical interaction analysis, and event-studies-oriented set-theoretical visualizations. Implications for big data analytics, current limitations of the set-theoretical approach, and future directions are outlined.",
          "Social scientists have long made use of advanced computational techniques in their research. There have been two very different applications of computational technologies in social science: one largely about simulation of complex political interactions, the other focused on the use of computational approaches with data to estimate models of political phenomenon. In this chapter, our emphasis is generally on the latter area of computational social science, and while we provide some grounding in the early and foundational work in this area, we mainly discuss recent research in computational social science applications involving data and model estimation.",
          "Social movement organizations widely use social media to organize collective action for social change, such as cancer awareness campaigns. However, little is known about how effective online social movement campaigns are at generating social change by translating online action into meaningful (offline) action. This dissertation examines the micro-mobilization dynamics at play that can explain the effectiveness of online social movement campaigns. This book comprises seven chapters presenting research based on a multidisciplinary, mixed-meethod approach combining theories and methods from sociology, social psychology, communication science, and computational social science. The findings show that, by looking at the micro-mobilization dynamics of collective action, we can gain an important understanding of the mechanisms at work during online social movement campaigns and of the effectiveness of such campaigns in fostering communication processes related to the cause, obtaining important resources for the cause, developing a collective identity, and raising awareness.",
          "Among legumes, pulses (lentils, peas, chickpeas, dried beans, etc.) are key crops for the transition to healthy and sustainable food systems, thanks to their agro-environmental and nutritional properties. However, their consumption and production remain very low. Some authors have put forward the hypothesis that this paradoxical situation is the result of a technological lock-in of agri-food systems around the conventional production paradigm (intensive use of synthetic inputs) and a predominantly meat-based diet, thus hampering the development of these species, particularly in Europe. New knowledge and innovations are therefore required to overcome this lock-in situation. Based on these hypotheses, this PhD in economics developed several original text mining methods applied to the analysis of science and product innovations, to account for the legume development trajectories on a global scale and over the last few decades. The thesis begins by reviewing how the concepts of technological lock-in and path dependency have been mobilized to account for the problems and issues facing the agri-food sector. This first analysis reveals the small number of works in this field, and their strong focus on specific themes. Among them, the role of science and product innovations on the market are almost absent. The rest of this PhD then focuses, on a global and/or European scale, on the state of scientific knowledge on legumes in the field of Food Science and Technology (FS&T), and on the state of food product innovations for these species on the markets. To carry out this pioneering analysis, the PhD developed dedicated methods rooted in the fields of textual data mining and Scientometrics (analysis of bibliographic networks). The PhD quantitatively demonstrates the predominance of certain legume species, and first soy, historically and globally invested by the agricultural sector, whether in the development of science or of product innovations. To reach this result, the PhD enabled the identification of the lexical variations, as well as the contexts of enunciation, for some thirty leguminous species, most of which are cultivated in temperate environments with the support of groups of experts in the field of FS&T. Thanks to this interdisciplinary work, a first step towards the evaluation of market biodiversity is proposed, in connection with the evaluation of technological lock-in processes around dominant species. The thesis then puts forward a series of hypotheses to account for the co-evolutionary processes observed between scientific knowledge and agro-industrial innovation markets for legumes. The thesis as a whole offers new insights into science and innovation policy from an agri-food sector sustainability perspective, and provides new perspectives in the study of knowledge and innovation trajectories using computational social science methods.",
          "In quantitative research on political science, classical statistics have been used as the fundamental toolbox to discover causal relationships and generate insights regarding a multitude of phenomena. With the increase in volume of social data, more advanced statistical and moreover machine learning (ML) methods have been developed in order to be able to unravel the complex (non-linear) relationships between phenomena. Social and political scientists are increasingly open to using data-driven methods in the analysis of empirical data. Due to this acceptance and maturation of data-driven methods, the domain of computational social science has been established. Although ML methods are increasing in popularity, currently no review exists on their usage in political science and whether they provide added value in investigating political science issues. We are interested in why a certain ML method is applied (i.e., which domain and research question), how the ML method is tailored to the context of the described political phenomenon, and whether an added value can be discerned. Concretely, are authors using standard out-of-the-box ML software packages or do they have a deeper understanding of the actual ML method, are the obtained results therefore optimal, and how do their results compare to classical statistical methods. Furthermore, we want to answer the question whether in the domain of political science and political communication, the use of ML methods is consistently used, i.e. whether for certain analysis type the same ML method is used. Lastly, we will explore whether there are gaps and opportunities for further research.",

          "The Kronecker product is a key algorithm and is ubiquitous across the physical, biological, and computation social sciences. Thus considerations of optimal implementation are important. The need to have high performance and computational reproducibility is paramount. Moreover, due to the need to compose multiple Kronecker products, issues related to data structures, layout and indexing algebra require a new look at an old problem. This paper discusses the outer product/tensor product and a special case of the tensor product: the Kronecker product, along with optimal implementation when composed, and mapped to complex processor/memory hierarchies. We discuss how the use of ``A Mathematics of Arrays\" (MoA), and the psi-Calculus, (a calculus of indexing with shapes), provides optimal, verifiable, reproducible, scalable, and portable implementations of both hardware and software.",
          "Collective memory is a common representation of the past shared by a group of people that modulates its identity. Recent literature on computational social science quantifies collective memories using expressions of those memories operationalized as the amount of collective attention focused on specific cultural icons, either artifacts or people. We model the temporal dynamics of collective memory using a two-step decay process, characterized by a short-lived and intense initial stage followed by a long-lived and milder decline of collective attention. Different collective memory mechanisms sustain the two-step process. The first is communicative memory, which corresponds to all memories supported by socializing acts. The second is cultural memory, which corresponds to all memories sustained by accessing records. Thus, this model predicts a transition time when cultural memory overcomes communicative memory. It has practical consequences related to shrinking or extending the time a specific topic is part of a community's conversation, i.e., communicative memory, empowering policymakers with valuable time to generate solutions and compromises for contingent and public problems.",

It employed a computational social science methodology that used textual analysis, followed by a constructivist grounded theoretic approach to inform just policy design. The analysis was performed at two scales to identify and contrast injustices in the study areas. The result at an aggregated scale showed commonalities were around the poor design of the built environment, administrative lags of the utilities and high electricity bills. Case study-specific results showed that poverty penalties were linked with the energy cultures of each SRHs. In the Mumbai case, poverty penalties were associated with the aspirational purchase of household appliances due to move from slums to SRH. The Abuja case showed low power quality and load shedding frequently damaged appliances that increase the maintenance costs for the occupants. The Rio de Janeiro SRH case had injustices embedded through the adoption of inefficient appliances received as charity from higher-income households. Fuel stacking was also observed in the SRH that illustrated cultural identities associated with cooking energy. The conclusion was drawn to support just policy design by considering the socio-cultural context of the built environment, improving utility governance and promoting cleaner fuel mix at the household level.",

          "Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. There is a dearth of large annotated training datasets in the multimedia domain hindering the development of supervised learn-ing models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. On the other hand, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question-answering, and topic classification. To leverage such advanced techniques to bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing long videos to generate their descriptions in natural language, followed by performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on fifteen video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised baselines for video understanding. Furthermore, to alleviate a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science on persuasion strategy identification.",
          "Computational social science projects often quickly expand in the quantity and complexity of their data and software needs.

          "Abstract In her 2021 IC2S2 keynote talk, “Critical Data Theory,” Margaret Hu builds off Critical Race Theory, privacy law, and big data surveillance to grapple with questions at the intersection of big data and legal jurisprudence. As a legal scholar, Hu’s work focuses primarily on issues of governance and regulation—examining the legal and constitutional impact of modern data collection and analysis. Yet, her call for Critical Data Theory has important implications for the field of Computational Social Science (CSS) as a whole. In this article, I therefore reflect on Hu’s conception of Critical Data Theory and its broader implications for CSS research. Specifically, I’ll consider the ramifications of her work for the scientific community—exploring how we as researchers should think about the ethics and realities of the data which forms the foundations of our work.",
          "Collective behavior in human society is attracting a lot of attention, particularly as the result of novel emergent phenomena associated with online social media and networks. In effect, although crowd wisdom and herding behavior have been well studied in social science, the rapid development of Internet computing and e-commerce brings further needs of in-depth comprehension of their consequences and impact from a technological perspective. Based on social learning, an analytical knowledge originated in social science, we re-examine the well-known phenomenon of information cascade, whereby rational agents can ignore personal knowledge to follow a predominant social behavior triggered by earlier decisions made by peers. Moreover, we look into the cascade behavior from a communication theoretic perspective, interpreting social learning as a distributed data processing scheme. This perspective enables the development of a novel framework, which allows a characterization of the conditions that trigger information cascades and trace their impact on the accuracy of the collective inference. Finally, potential applications and examples of information cascade have been presented under various cyber technological scenarios, illustrating the prolific interplay between communication technology and computational social science.",
          "Abstract Smart grids are typically modelled as cyber–physical power systems, with limited consideration given to the social aspects. Specifically, traditional power system studies tend to overlook the behaviour of stakeholders, such as end‐users. However, the impact of end‐users and their behaviour on power system operation and response to disturbances is significant, particularly with respect to demand response and distributed energy resources. Therefore, it is essential to plan and operate smart grids by taking into account both the technical and social aspects, given the crucial role of active and passive end‐users, as well as the intermittency of renewable energy sources. In order to optimize system efficiency, reliability, and resilience, it is important to consider the level of cooperation, flexibility, and other social features of various stakeholders, including consumers, prosumers, and microgrids. This article aims to address the gaps and challenges associated with modelling social behaviour in power systems, as well as the human‐centred approach for future development and validation of socio‐technical power system models. As the cyber–physical–social system of energy emerges as an important topic, it is imperative to adopt a human‐centred approach in this domain. Considering the significance of computational social science for power system applications, this article proposes a list of research topics that must be addressed to improve the reliability and resilience of power systems in terms of both operation and planning. Solving these problems could have far‐reaching implications for power systems, energy markets, community usage, and energy strategies.",
          "There is growing research interest in the sharing of emotions through social media. Usually centred on ‘newsworthy’ events and collective ‘flows’ of emotion, this work is often computationally driven. This article presents an interaction-led analysis of small data from Twitter to illustrate how this kind of intensive focus can ‘thicken’ claims about emotions, and particularly empathy. Drawing on Goffman’s work on ritual, we introduce and then apply the idea of ‘empathy rituals’ to exchanges about emotional distress on Twitter, a platform primarily researched using big data approaches. While the potential of Goffman’s work has been explored in some depth in relation to digital performances, its emotional dimension has been less fully examined. Through a focus on Twitter conversations, we show how reading small data can inform computational social science claims about emotions and add to sociological understanding of emotion in (digital) publics.",

          "We have entered a new era of scholarship: the computational era. As digitized data and computational methods revolutionize the way we understand ourselves, society, and our place in society, these methods have revived questions about the role of science and objectivity in understanding society. For some, this moment has reanimated the ideal of science as disembodied objectivity, a totalizing ideology long critiqued by feminist and other critical theorists. For others, computational methods have the potential to make transparent the necessary interplay between subject and object in producing knowledge, enhancing the ideal of embodied objectivity. Starting from the premise that objectivity in knowledge creation is a worthy—even utopian—pursuit, this essay argues four things. First, applying computational methods toward the goal of disembodied objectivity profoundly misunderstands the nature of the methods and undermines the revolutionary potential of the current moment for the social sciences and humanities. Second, computational methods are instead perfectly aligned with, and can be used to enhance, the embodied vision of objectivity. Third, embodied objectivity enables us to better leverage computational tools to produce more accurate accounts of the world. Fourth, I borrow from the theory of situated knowledges and partial perspectives to provide four principles to guide this new era of scholarship.",
          "This chapter introduces a theoretical and analytical framework that allows the field of communication to adapt to the research challenges of the digital age. In this framework, we use the term ‘networked communication’ to refer to the ability to leverage digital trace data to advance theoretical and empirical research goals. In particular, new data resources and computational tools allow us to improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of communication, spanning levels of analyses that go from the individual to the group and, from there, to organizations, collectives, and societies. The approach we propose here lies at the confluence of network science and computational social science, and it has many different applications as illustrated by the thirty-two chapters that form the <italic>Handbook</italic>. At the heart of this approach is the principle that we need to embrace the complex and dynamic nature of communication processes. We can only theorize about thoses processes by bringing new empirical light and methodoloigical sophistication to the old questions about the nature, determinants, and outcomes of human communication in an increasingly interconnected environment.",
          "The burst of Web 2.0 services during the early years of the 21 century generated along list of online social media platforms cultivating online participatory culture. In 2018 about 69% of adult Americans used at least one of the major online social media platforms. Online social media platforms gather and store different kinds of data, for example concerning the interaction of users with their platforms as well as the communication patterns among users. This renaissance of big data – a term that refers to the explosion of available data – is characterized by continuous production of high dimensional and unstructured data that is being collected at an unprecedented scale and with relatively low cost. This renaissance offers social scientists novel opportunities to study humans’ behavior out of the lab in massive scales. Analyzing this data, however,is highly challenging due to its high dimensionality, the large amount of noise, incidental endogeneity, and spurious correlations. To exhaust the potential opportunities and to discover complex patterns embodied in this data, it is therefore crucial for social scientists to be equipped with field knowledge in modern machine learning techniques,computer science, statistics, and mathematics._x000D_\nThe focus of this dissertation lies on generating political knowledge from the huge amounts of data being generated on online social media platforms. The first part of the dissertation serves as a general introduction to Social Big Data, the opportunities for its political exploration, and the challenges that come with it. Additionally, a general framework to continuously store raw social media data on scalable distributed databases is introduced. In the second part, the theoretical basis for efficiently analyzing the data is described, on basis of which the proper quantitative tools for generating knowledge are developed._x000D_\nFor the theoretical part of this thesis a wide range of algorithms are developed, all of which have the goal of filling the theoretical gap between the different aspects of social sciences and computational sciences. The main two papers constituting this dissertation are based on state-of-the-art network theory tools. In Estimating the Political Orientation of Twitter Users in Homophilic Networks by Shahrezaye et al. efficient algorithms based on metric learning and Harmonic functions are developed to efficiently estimate the political orientation of mass Twitter users using less than fifty training observations per class. Measuring the Ease of Communication in Bipartite Social Endorsement Networks by Shahrezaye et al. measures the overall efficiency of communication in social networks which have a positive-degree correlation between neighboring vertices, the so-called networks with assortative mixing. Additionally, a polarization index is derived/defined, which can be used to measure the the level of political polarization between the sub-clusters of online social networks. In Distorting political communication: The Effect of Hyperactive Users in Online Social Networks by Papakyriakopoulos et al. the hyperactive users are theoretically and mathematically defined. It is then shown that hyperactive users can turn to be opinion-leaders on online social platforms and that they can affect the political discourse on these platforms.",
          "Crowdsourced applications to scientific problems is a hot research area, with over 10,000 publications in the past five years. Platforms such as Amazons Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower provide researchers with easy access to large numbers of workers. The crowds vast supply of inexpensive, intelligent labor allows people to attack problems that were previously impractical and gives potential for detailed scientific inquiry of social, psychological, economic, and linguistic phenomena via massive sample sizes of human annotated data. We introduce crowdsourcing and describe how it is being used in both industry and academia. Crowdsourcing is valuable to computational linguists both (a) as a source of labeled training data for use in machine learning and (b) as a means of collecting computational social science data that link language use to underlying beliefs and behavior. We present case studies for both categories: (a) collecting labeled data for use in natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation and machine translation and (b) collecting experimental data in the context of psychology; e.g. finding how word use varies with age, sex, personality, health, and happiness. We will also cover tools and techniques for crowdsourcing. Effectively collecting crowdsourced data requires careful attention to the collection process, through selection of appropriately qualified workers, giving clear instructions that are understandable to non-?experts, and performing quality control on the results to eliminate spammers who complete tasks randomly or carelessly in order to collect the small financial reward. We will introduce different crowdsourcing platforms, review privacy and institutional review board issues, and provide rules of thumb for cost and time estimates. Crowdsourced data also has a particular structure that raises issues in statistical analysis; we describe some of the key methods to address these issues. No prior exposure to the area is required.",
          "This Open Access book outlines ideas for a novel, scalable and, above all, sustainable financial system. We all know that today’s global markets are unsustainable and global governance is not effective enough. Given this situation, could one boost smart human coordination, sustainability and resilience by tweaking society at its core: the monetary system? A Computational Social Science team at ETH Zürich has indeed worked on a concept and little demonstrator for a new financial system, called “Finance 4.0” or just “FIN4”, which combines blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (“IoT”). What if communities could reward sustainable actions by issuing their own money (“tokens”)? Would people behave differently, when various externalities became visible and were actionable through cryptographic tokens? Could a novel, participatory, multi-dimensional financial system be created? Could it be run by the people for the people and lead to more societal resilience than today’s financial system (which is effectively one-dimensional due to its almost frictionless exchange)? How could one manage such a system in an ethical and democratic way? This book presents some early attempts in a nascent field, but provides a fresh view on what cryptoeconomic systems could do for us, for a circular economy, and for scalable, sustainable action.",
          "An extensive literature in computational social science examines how features of messages, advertisements, and other corpora affect individuals' decisions, but these analyses must specify the relevant features of the text before the experiment.Automated text analysis methods are able to discover features of text, but these methods cannot be used to obtain the estimates of causal effects-the quantity of interest for applied researchers.We introduce a new experimental design and statistical model to simultaneously discover treatments in a corpora and estimate causal effects for these discovered treatments.We prove the conditions to identify the treatment effects of texts and introduce the supervised Indian Buffet process to discover those treatments.Our method enables us to discover treatments in a training set using a collection of texts and individuals' responses to those texts, and then estimate the effects of these interventions in a test set of new texts and survey respondents.We apply the model to an experiment about candidate biographies, recovering intuitive features of voters' decisions and revealing a penalty for lawyers and a bonus for military service.",

          "Computational social welfare, a powerful new science, combines a focal commitment to social justice and equity with adoption of computational modeling as an epistemological paradigm and with advanced data science skills as the methodology. As a science focused on learning from data, it mirrors the values and processes of grounded theory already well established in social welfare and it elevates the use of administrative data, which is so prevalent in the social settings of interest to social welfare scholars. As a science deeply rooted in complexity theory, it promises to produce new insights about the complex and adaptive social environments in which social workers practice and conduct research. As an inherently cross-disciplinary science, it welcomes new perspectives about how to understand and solve social problems. As a science led by innovations and one in use outside of universities with later adoption by academic researchers, it provides a template for social welfare to embrace an action-oriented research agenda led by practitioners and communities. In this way, it aligns well with the participatory paradigm already embraced by many social welfare scholars. As a science that promotes transparency and open access, it facilitates a critical paradigm that can challenge oppressive beliefs and practices embedded in traditional, historical, and legacy research traditions. Computational social welfare is situated within the umbrella of computational social science. It is analogous to computational approaches in other fields, including computational biology, computational linguistics, computational finance, and computational cognition. All computational approaches exist within the broader domain of computational science, understood to be a science that uses networks, computers, software, algorithms, and simulations to create new knowledge. Please refer to the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Philosophy article “Computational Science” for more information. Computational social welfare also benefits from technology development. Technology innovation provides a foundation for computational social welfare. However, computational social welfare focuses more on application and analysis than hardware development. Please refer to the separate Oxford Bibliographies in Social Work articles “Technology in Social Work” and “Technology for Social Work Interventions” for more information about technology in social work. Computational social welfare seems like a science well suited for solving modern social challenges. However, it has not yet been widely embraced and tested by social welfare scholars. Therefore, this article aims to introduce the various facets of computational social welfare to practitioners and scholars dedicated to social well-being with a goal of advancing its use and testing. It is generally focused on the field of social welfare but will be of interest to those involved in, and it draws citations from, fields that share a commitment to improving conditions for people, including but not limited to public policy, sociology, economics, nursing, education, criminal justice, public health, psychology, and political science. Social work practitioners can learn how data science is applied in other disciplines for social well-being, including trends, argument, methods, and analysis, that could inspire social welfare scholars to enhance the social work discipline.",
          "What makes health news articles attractable and viral? Why do some articles diffuse widely by prompting audience selections (attractability) and subsequent social retransmissions (virality), while others do not? Identifying what drives social epidemics of health news coverage is crucial to our understanding of its impact on the public, especially in the emerging media environment where news consumption has become increasingly selective and social. This dissertation examines how message features and social influence affect the volume and persistence of attractability and virality within the context of the online diffusion of New York Times (NYT) health news articles. The dissertation analyzes (1) behavioral data of audience selections and retransmissions of the NYT articles and (2) associated article content and context data that are collected using computational social science approaches (automated data mining; computer-assisted content analysis) along with more traditional methods (manual content analysis; message evaluation survey). Analyses of message effects on the total volume of attractability and virality show that articles with high informational utility and positive sentiment invite more frequent selections and retransmissions, and that articles are also more attractable when presenting controversial, emotionally evocative, and familiar content. Furthermore, these analyses reveal that informational utility and novelty have stronger positive associations with email-specific virality, while emotion-related message features, content familiarity, and exemplification play a larger role in triggering social media-based retransmissions. Temporal dynamics analyses demonstrate social influence-driven cumulative advantage effects, such that articles which stay on popular-news lists longer invite more frequent subsequent selections and retransmissions. These analyses further show that the social influence effects are stronger for articles containing message features found to enhance the total volume of attractability and virality. This suggests that those synergistic interactions might underlie the observed message effects on total selections and retransmissions. Exploratory analyses reveal that the effects of social influence and message features tend to be similar for both (1) the volume of audience news selections and retransmissions and (2) the persistence of those behaviors. However, some message features, such as expressed emotionality, are relatively unique predictors of persistence outcomes. Results are discussed in light of their implications for communication research and practice.",
          "The article describes models of research practices in the digital network environment that expand boundaries of sociological and social research: “computational social science”, “computational sociology”, “e-social science”, “digital sociology”, “digital social science”, “digital social research”. Particular attention is paid to re-location of this type of research from academic institutions to corporate research laboratories in order to ascertain relationship of the above models with digital social sciences on the level of methods and common projects.",
          "Information technology plays a significant role in what has become known as «computational social science». The development of online technologies and digital research methods in the subject areas of social science is associated with the application of new interdisciplinary approaches and the integration of researchers from different fields of knowledge. As an effective and promising tool for researchers in the study of violent ideologies that destabilize the social order, the article discusses examples of databases, services and platforms for multivariate analysis. Opportunities and imitations of customizing data collection, processing, and presentation are outlined. An overview of the specific characteristics of the databases, services and platforms on the START Research Center website is presented. Conclusions are made about what opportunities such tools open for researchers and the prospects of realization of the most interesting solutions for improving the process of automation of data analysis are outlined.",
          "The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present a challenge due to their potential for conflicting objectives, which hinders their effective implementation. In order to address the complexity of sustainability issues, a framework capable of capturing the specificity of diverse sustainability issues while offering a common methodology applicable across contexts is required. Co-creative communication can be regarded as a key source of uncertainty within functional systems, as it can be instrumental in realizing and sustaining sustainability. In this regard, the studies in Constructive approaches to Co-creative Communication (CCC), particularly those employing artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies such as computational social science and innovation studies, hold significant value for both theoretical and applied sustainability research. However, existing CCC frameworks cannot be directly applied to sustainability research. This work bridges this gap by proposing a framework that outlines a general approach to establishing formalized definitions of sustainability from the lens of communication. This approach enables the direct application of CCC models to sustainability studies. The framework is based on systems theory and the methodologies of artificial intelligence, including computational/symbolic modeling and formal methods. This framework emphasizes the social function of co-creative communication and the interaction between the innovation process and the sustainability of the system. It can be concluded that the application of our framework enables the achievements of CCC to be directly applied to sustainability research. Researchers from different disciplines are therefore able to establish their own specific definitions of sustainability, which are tailored to their particular concerns. Our framework lays the groundwork for future sustainability studies that employs CCC, facilitating the integration of CCC insights into sustainability research and application. The outcomes of computational creativity research based on AI technologies, such as distributed artificial intelligence and self-organizing networks, can deepen the understanding of sustainability mechanisms and drive their practical applications. Furthermore, the functional role of co-creative communication in societal sustainability proposed in this work offers a novel perspective for future discussions on the evolutionary adaptation of co-creative communication.",
          "Existing work on the alignment problem has focused mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a monolith. Recent sociotechnical approaches highlight the need to understand complex misalignment among multiple human and AI agents. We address this gap by adapting a computational social science model of human contention to the alignment problem. Our model quantifies misalignment in large, diverse agent groups with potentially conflicting goals across various problem areas. Misalignment scores in our framework depend on the observed agent population, the domain in question, and conflict between agents' weighted preferences. Through simulations, we demonstrate how our model captures intuitive aspects of misalignment across different scenarios. We then apply our model to two case studies, including an autonomous vehicle setting, showcasing its practical utility. Our approach offers enhanced explanatory power for complex sociotechnical environments and could inform the design of more aligned AI systems in real-world applications.",
          "Identity-related issues play central roles in many current events, including those involving factional politics, sectarianism, and tribal conflicts. Two popular models from the computational-social-science (CSS) literature - the threat anticipation program and SharedID models - incorporate notions of identity (individual and collective) and processes of identity formation. A multiscale conceptual framework that extends some ideas presented in these models and draws other capabilities from the broader CSS literature is useful in modeling the formation of political identities. The dynamic, multiscale processes that constitute and transform social identities can be mapped to expressive structures of the framework.",
          "The social sciences have produced an impressive body of research on determinants of fertility outcomes, or whether and when people have children. However, the strength of these determinants and underlying theories are rarely evaluated on their predictive ability on new data. This prevents us from systematically comparing studies, hindering the evaluation and accumulation of knowledge. In this paper, we present two datasets which can be used to study the predictability of fertility outcomes in the Netherlands. One dataset is based on the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey which includes thousands of variables on a wide range of topics, including individual preferences and values. The other is based on the Dutch register data which lacks attitudinal data but includes detailed information about the life courses of millions of Dutch residents. We provide information about the datasets and the samples, and describe the fertility outcome of interest. We also introduce the fertility prediction data challenge PreFer which is based on these datasets and will start in Spring 2024. We outline the ways in which measuring the predictability of fertility outcomes using these datasets and combining their strengths in the data challenge can advance our understanding of fertility behaviour and computational social science. We further provide details for participants on how to take part in the data challenge.",
          "Many questions in computational social science rely on datasets assembled from heterogeneous online sources, a process that is often labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to reproduce. Recent advances in large language models enable agentic search and structured extraction from the web, but existing systems are frequently opaque, inflexible, or poorly suited to scientific data curation. Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation. By lowering the technical and labor barriers to online data assembly, DataParasite provides a practical foundation for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation in computational social science and beyond.",
          "The relationship between reading exposure and social attitudes across demographic groups remains a pivotal yet underexplored topic in computational social science. This study adopts a machine learning framework to examine the symmetry of reading’s influence on social attitude formation. Models including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and linear regression were employed on data from the 2021 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). The results show that reading volume is a key predictor of social attitudes. Moreover, a SHAP-based subgroup analysis revealed that the impact of reading exposure remained stable across gender groups, indicating a symmetric pattern of cognitive influence. This study proposes a methodological pipeline for assessing the symmetry of feature importance in social data, offering actionable insights for researchers and policymakers into the equitable role of media consumption in shaping social cognition.",
          "In his Perspective “Ensuring the data-rich future of the social sciences” (special section on Dealing with Data, 11 February, p. [719][1]), G. King discusses the potential to transform the future of social science using existing “huge quantities of digital information about people.” As King states, the business sector has proven that powerful informatics applied to data about people can support better decision-making and foster innovation.\n\nThe same could be done to tackle difficult social problems once we figure out how to assemble and share large data sets while protecting privacy. King suggests building data archives to facilitate reuse of data. Large data archives already exist on survey data ([ 1 ][2]–[ 5 ][3]), but little attention has been given to government administrative data, which is a key source of information about our society. From the day we are born until we die, most of our activities leave traces in various government databases. Indeed, these government information systems continuously generate data about all aspects of our society, much like the satellites we use to monitor our physical surroundings.\n\nUnfortunately, most administrative data are left to languish in legacy databases after their original use. We must invest in efforts to build a systematic pipeline to extract data from these systems for secondary analysis. A well-integrated federated data system of administrative databases updated on an ongoing basis could hold a collective representation of our society. Designed, built, and properly managed by experts under appropriate protocols and oversight, such a data infrastructure could transform the social sciences and still protect individual privacy, just as well-maintained satellite data have transformed astronomy. A secure data infrastructure is critical for government decision support systems, transparency and accountability in government, and ultimately computational social science research. The Census Bureau ([ 5 ][3]) and others ([ 6 ][4], [ 7 ][5]) have already demonstrated the enormous potential of federated administrative data systems.\n\n1.

          "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Emotional support plays a crucial role in enhancing social interactions, facilitating psychological interventions, and improving customer service outcomes by addressing individuals' emotional needs. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) holds promise for delivering emotional support on a large scale, but their effectiveness compared to human counselors is still not well understood. Evaluating and enhancing the emotional support capabilities of LLMs through targeted user-centered strategies is crucial for their successful real-world integration. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This study aims to evaluate the emotional support capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, and to introduce an integrative automatic evaluation framework centered on user-perceived feedback. The framework is designed to enhance LLM performance in emotional support conversations (ESCs) by identifying psycholinguistic clues as intrinsic evaluation metrics and leveraging a customized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting framework. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> The study used a dataset of emotional support conversations from human counselors. An explanatory predictive model was developed using explainable artificial intelligence methods, following an integrative modeling paradigm rooted in computational social science. The model evaluated and interpreted user-perceived feedback scores for GPT-4o. Additionally, the study integrated Hill’s three-stage model of helping into a manually customized chain of thought prompting framework to systematically evaluate GPT-4o's performance in ESCs. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> GPT-4o achieved high user-perceived feedback scores, demonstrating relative stability in its performance, but it still significantly trails behind human counselors overall (Cliff's Delta = 0.087, p &lt; 0.001). The evaluation framework, which identified 41 distinct linguistic clues related to emotional expression, social dynamics, cognitive processes, linguistic style, and decision-making stages, enhanced the understanding of both processes and outcomes in ESCs. Notably, GPT-4o's user-perceived feedback scores significantly improved with the use of manually customized Chain of Thought prompts (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d: 0.378), but showing no significant difference from the average performance of human counselors overall (p-adj: 0.47, Cliff's Delta: -0.014). However, thought prompts demonstrate a significant advantage in specific emotion categories such as fear (p: 0.002, Cliff's Delta: -0.23), sadness (p: 0.012, Cliff's Delta: -0.105), and break up with partner issues (p: 0.254, Cliff's Delta: -0.06). However, GPT-4o exhibited weaknesses in emotional understanding, cognitive complexity, language fluency, and handling extreme scenarios. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This study provides preliminary evidence of GPT-4o's emotional support capabilities and proposes a user-perceived feedback-centered integrative evaluation framework for ESCs. The findings suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for the application of advanced large language models (LLMs) in emotional support services, although significant challenges remain, particularly in enhancing the depth of exploration in conversations and the personalization of language. The proposed framework encourages the integration of human expertise into LLMs, enhancing their efficacy and advancing the development of trustworthy AI-based emotional support services. </sec>",

          "Computational Social Science (CSS) has emerged as a fast-developing scientific field. Its growth has been driven by the increasing availability of computational power, coordinated digitization, annotation and interoperability efforts, and large-scale data on social activities. computing, data sciences and the social sciences created a loop, opening new fields of inquiry and forming new methodologies, making way for innovative approaches, and potentially leading to fresh discoveries. The papers in this special issue cover a wide range of phenomena using computational methods, such as social media, simulation, creative and cultural industries, as well as infrastructures for CSS. They apply CSS methods including social network analysis, virtual encounter simulations, sentiment and emotion analysis, and corpus linguistics, to case studies ranging from Covid-19 pandemic to electoral behavior, to political charisma, to cultural affinities and value orientation to border regions, to esports networks, to museums, to national and international infrastructures, thus providing a spectrum of possibilities (and limitations) for social scientists.",
          "How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.",
          "This thesis investigates the relationships between surveillance, acts of resistance to surveillance and their respective roles in the contemporary social order. The context for this investigation is the contemporary ‘information society’. This is characterised by globally networked information and communication technologies, and is represented most plainly by one medium in particular: the Internet. The Internet has historically been a contested domain; it represents, for some, the cornerstone of civil liberties yet at the same time it is highly regulated and susceptible to control. The significant social, cultural, economic and political impacts of the Internet include the proliferation of techniques of digital surveillance. However, while the Internet has facilitated the growth of these practices, it has also created new opportunities for resistance to surveillance. By attending to the social dynamics and mechanics of resistance, we can generate more nuanced and subtle understandings of the ways in which social control is being performed.&#13;\\nA framework of nodal governance steers this research. Consequently, this study locates these dynamics within three specific sites: online civil society, the regulatory process and the media. These cases demonstrate how a range of social actors, across a variety of settings, are implicated in the dynamics of digital surveillance and resistance. An innovative, multi-strategy approach to the fieldwork, including computational social science methods, captures these emergent dynamics as they are played out. The analysis of the data is guided by a theoretical preoccupation with control that serves to illustrate its plural and fluid character. Central to this are social and technological networks as forms of organisation and communication that facilitate surveillance and resistance. The thesis concludes that contemporary social control is an inherently socio-technical process, shaped primarily by dynamics of digital surveillance and resistance.",

          "This dataset contains annotations of social media posts from X (Twitter) and TikTok collected around the October 13, 2025 release of the last living hostages taken during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. The dataset was compiled as part of the class \"Israel on Social Media\" at Indiana University. Content: The dataset contains 340 social media posts (189 from X, 151 from TikTok) collected across three time periods using the search term \"Israel\": about two weeks before October 13, 2025 (baseline period); October 13, 2025 (day of the hostage release); and about two weeks after October 13, 2025 (aftermath period). Posts were retrieved from fresh accounts without browsing history to capture content as it would appear to new users. The distribution of posts by platform and time period is as follows: Platform Pre-Oct 13 Oct 13 Post-Oct 13 Total X (Twitter) 65 58 66 189 TikTok 42 38 71 151 Note: Some posts appeared in multiple time periods. Annotation: Each post was annotated by multiple coders (18–19 annotators for X samples, 10–11 annotators for TikTok samples) on the following dimensions: Views of Israel (5-point scale: 1=Very Negative to 5=Very Positive) Antisemitism according to the IHRA definition (5-point scale: Certainly not, Probably not, Don't know, Probably yes, Certainly yes) IHRA Section (which specific provision of the IHRA working definition applies, if any) Themes (e.g., Hostages, Ceasefire, Destruction in Gaza, Hamas, Israel/Jewish pride) Conspiracy theories (specific types) Calling out antisemitism (whether the post critiques rather than expresses antisemitism) File Description: The dataset is provided in wide format (.xlsx), with each row representing a single post. Columns include: Platform: X or TikTok Time_Period: Pre-Oct 13, Oct 13, or Post-Oct 13 Sample_ID: Identifier for the sample batch Sample_Name: Name of the sample Sr_Number: Post number within sample Object_ID: Unique identifier for the post Annotator_[1-19]_Views_of_Israel: Each annotator's rating of views toward Israel Annotator_[1-19]_Is_Antisemitic_IHRA: Each annotator's assessment of antisemitism Annotator_[1-19]_IHRA_Section: IHRA provisions identified by each annotator Annotator_[1-19]_Calling_out_Antisemitism: Whether post calls out antisemitism Annotator_[1-19]_Includes_Conspiracy: Conspiracy theory content identified Annotator_[1-19]_Themes: Themes identified by each annotator Annotator_[1-19]_Comments: Annotator comments Annotator_[1-19]_Time_Taken: Time spent on annotation (seconds) Acknowledgements: We are grateful for the contributions and annotations of all students in the \"Israel on Social Media\" class at Indiana University in Fall 2025.

          "ABSTRACTDespite international efforts to address human-caused climate change, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. However, existing literature often overlooks the role of the state and social actors in exacerbating or mitigating emissions. This study adopts the political-economic embeddedness perspective to argue that the role of the state and social actors cannot be separated in the greenhouse gas economy. Specifically, we explore how the embeddedness within the Taiwanese state and private corporations enables resistance to greenhouse gas reduction policies. Through an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions data and examination of corporate characteristics among major emitters in Taiwan, we find that two key legacies of Taiwan's developmental state period, family-controlled firms and private corporations with more governmental directors, tend to have higher emissions levels. Importantly, these legacies persist even after neo-liberal reforms. This study's findings have implications for developing countries, particularly in Asia, that employ developmental state strategies. It underscores the need for countries to consider the potential negative impacts of state intervention and market dynamics on greenhouse gas emissions.KEYWORDS: Greenhouse gas emissionsclimate changestateprivate corporationsdevelopmental stateneo-liberalism Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 The terms in parentheses are abbreviated names for the variables as they appear in the models and Tables 1–6.2 The five industries are cement, semiconductor, electricity, steel, and liquid crystal display.3 The permanent link to the data is: https://data.epa.gov.tw/en/dataset/detail/GHG_P_014 We categorize the firms into eleven distinct industry sectors: cement, food, petrochemical, textile, chemical, paper, semiconductor and liquid crystal display, electricity, steel, tire rubber, and a miscellaneous group for remaining industries. Due to the table design for our models, we excluded the industry results in the table. The coefficients of several industries are statistically significant: Cement (0.104, p < 0.001), Petrochemical (0.012, p < 0.05), Food (−0.019, p < 0.001), and Paper (0.015, p < 0.01).Additional informationNotes on contributorsChung-pei PienChung-pei Pien is an Assistant Professor at the International College of Innovation, National Chengchi University, and an Adjunct Assistant Research Fellow at the Risk Society and Policy Research Center, National Taiwan University.

          "Many questions in computational social science rely on datasets assembled from heterogeneous online sources, a process that is often labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to reproduce. Recent advances in large language models enable agentic search and structured extraction from the web, but existing systems are frequently opaque, inflexible, or poorly suited to scientific data curation. Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation. By lowering the technical and labor barriers to online data assembly, DataParasite provides a practical foundation for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation in computational social science and beyond.",
          "Abstract Computational Social Science (CSS) has grown exponentially as the process of datafication and computation has increased. This expansion, however, is yet to translate into effective actions to strengthen public good in the form of policy insights and interventions. This chapter presents 20 limiting factors in how data is accessed and analysed in the field of CSS. The challenges are grouped into the following six categories based on their area of direct impact: Data Ecosystem, Data Governance, Research Design, Computational Structures and Processes, the Scientific Ecosystem, and Societal Impact. Through this chapter, we seek to construct a taxonomy of CSS governance and policy challenges. By first identifying the problems, we can then move to effectively address them through research, funding, and governance agendas that drive stronger outcomes.",

The rich social media data generated in virtual worlds has important implications for business, education, social science, and society at large. Similarly, massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) have become increasingly popular and have online communities comprising tens of millions of players. They serve as unprecedented tools for theorizing about and empirically modeling the social and behavioral dynamics of individuals, groups, and networks within large communities.1–3 Some technologists consider virtual worlds and MMOGs to be likely candidates to become the Web 3.0. In such a “brave new world” of diverse online virtual civilizations, we believe AI can play a signifi cant role, from multiagent avatar research and immersive virtual interface design to virtual world and MMOG Web mining and computational social science modeling.",

          "Public response prediction is critical for understanding how individuals or groups might react to specific events, policies, or social phenomena, making it highly valuable for crisis management, policy-making, and social media analysis. However, existing works face notable limitations. First, they lack micro-level personalization, producing generic responses that ignore individual user preferences. Moreover, they overlook macro-level sentiment distribution and only deal with individual-level sentiment, constraining them from analyzing broader societal trends and group sentiment dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose SocialAlign, a unified framework that predicts real-world responses at both micro and macro levels in social contexts. At the micro level, SocialAlign employs SocialLLM with an articulate Personalized Analyze-Compose LoRA (PAC-LoRA) structure, which deploys specialized expert modules for content analysis and response generation across diverse topics and user profiles, enabling the generation of personalized comments with corresponding sentiments. At the macro level, it models group sentiment distributions and aligns predictions with real-world sentiment trends derived from social media data. To evaluate SocialAlign in real-world scenarios, we introduce SentiWeibo, a large-scale dataset curated from authentic social interactions on the Weibo platform. Experimental results on our SentiWeibo and related LaMP benchmark demonstrate that SocialAlign surpasses strong baselines, showing improved accuracy, interpretability, and generalization in public response prediction. We hope our work inspires further research in public response prediction and computational social science: https://github.com/Znull-1220/SocialAlign.",
          "Open source software represents a novel form of organizing that leaves digital trace data for organizational researchers to analyze using computational methods. Computational social science has emerged as an important approach to understanding patterns that represent latent social structures in sociological, organizational, and technical phenomena. Within the context of open and digitalized collaboration the clearest manifestation of computational social science has been social network analysis. While social network analysis is a powerful approach for understanding social phenomena in terms of their latent relational social structure, the network lens does not capture the entirety of social structures. Procedural social structures undergirding recurrent patterns of action form another important element of latent social structure. Analyzing such structures requires alternative methods able to deal with historydependent patterning of activities. Therefore, we investigate the concepts of latent relational and procedural structures, and discuss computational approaches for analyzing patterns and interdependencies among such structures.",

          "The strategic culture approach has been suffering from a prolonged theoretical stalemate, despite a surge in case studies, which culminated in the Johnston-Gray debate and subsequent schism. The present paper outlines a new approach designed to overcome this deadlock, and consists of three arguments. First, the three previous generations of strategic culture studies have failed to explain how strategic culture influences behaviour. Second, aligning strategic culture theory-building with discursive institutionalism offers a way to overcome this fundamental fallacy. Third, a research programme for strategic culture should draw on computational social science to enable it to present and test middle-range theories.",
          "Individual and community psychology plays an important role in disaster management as human behavior exhibit diverse risk perceptions, recognition of the threats that exists, positive and negative emotions, panic, anger, rumor, stress and learned helplessness. These psychological factors are important as lack of attention to these can lead to detrimental outcome of disaster management effort. Disaster psychology has been seen as an emerging area of research and practice which deals with understanding of the psychological impact of individuals and community aftermath of the disasters. The aim of this paper is to put forward the conceptualization and development of dynamic networked psychology as a theoretical framework and its implications in exploring emotional contagion during disasters. We advocate theories of structural network dynamics can be used to construct DNP for exploring individuals as well as community coping mechanisms for improving preparedness, response and recovery of disasters. The advent of computational social science promotes the empirical modelling and analysis of massive volume of user data by inferring meaningful patterns for finding answers to important social and behavioral science research questions dealing with individual and community coping ability. In presenting a theoretical framework, we suggest that the underlying assumptions and integration of theories of social influence can be used to explore networks of emotional contagion for disasters.",
          "Abstract The social sciences investigate human and social dynamics and organization at all levels of analysis (consilience), including cognition, decision making, behavior, groups, organizations, societies, and the world system. Computational social science is the integrated, interdisciplinary pursuit of social inquiry with emphasis on information processing and through the medium of advanced computation. The main computational social science areas are automated information extraction systems, social network analysis, social geographic information systems (GIS), complexity modeling, and social simulation models. Just like Galileo exploited the telescope as the key instrument for observing and gaining a deeper and empirically truthful understanding of the physical universe, computational social scientists are learning to exploit the advanced and increasingly powerful instruments of computation to see beyond the visible spectrum of more traditional disciplinary analyses.

          "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 19th ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work - ACM GROUP 2016. This year's conference continues the series' tradition of being truly international in both participation and organizational structure. The ACM GROUP 2016 program features diverse social, technical and cultural research traditions, as well as scholars from a wide range of disciplines, including Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Organization Science, Small Group Research, Computational Social Science, Sociotechnical System Design, Critical Design, Educational Technology and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. Participants in the program will discuss the latest findings within areas such as editing systems; enterprise social networks; local communities; volunteering; adoption, appropriation and domestication of technologies; and mobile computing. In recent years, ACM GROUP has been experimenting with different ideas to expand the scope of the conference. Working Papers were, for instance, added in 2014 with the idea to help a set of participants develop journal papers through short presentations and active engagement with the conference attendees. This new venue was a success and has been integrated into the conference. This year, the ACM GROUP program chairs introduce three innovations: ACM GROUP 2016 will open with a Keynote Symposium on Systems Work to reflect on the current state of the art and science in systems work, as well as on its future;A new track called Design Fictions: Exploring Future Research Agendas to explore possible futures for research on the relationships between computers and people; and,A JCSCW Papers session, featuring authors of recently published papers from CSCW, the Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices (Springer). These numbers show that ACM GROUP remains vibrant, with an almost equal number of reviewed research papers as in previous years, and record numbers of reviewed submissions for posters and doctoral colloquium. Research papers and design fictions continued the tradition of being completely reviewed by the Program Committee members without external reviewers. As in prior years, reviewing was conducted in two rounds. During the first round all committee members served exclusively as reviewers. In the second round, one reviewer on each paper was assigned the Primary AC role and asked to lead an online discussion of the paper and write a Meta-Review based on the content of the reviews and the discussion. The goal of the discussion and Meta-Review was to generate a proposed accept/reject decision. The program chairs then made their final decisions by considering all of the review scores and comments. Submissions for other venues were reviewed by their respective chairs.",
          "Abstract What factors determine the impact of a scientific paper? Does its impact extend to patents and software development, or is it primarily confined to academic circles? While current literature predominantly adopts a descriptive approach, emphasizing patent citations as indicators of industry impact, the role of research in driving software development is overlooked. To address this gap, we quantitatively assessed the impact of research papers on both patents and software repositories. With a computational social science approach, we collected, curated, and analyzed a large-scale dataset of 200K papers published between 1980 and 2022 across the research areas of AI, Computer Vision, Data Mining, Databases, HCI, and NLP, including conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, CVPR, CHI, KDD, and The Web Conference. We found that, on average, 7.1% of papers from these venues became patents and 11.6% went into repositories—significantly higher than top general science journals (3.8% for patents and 0.02% for repositories). Despite being a minority, these papers have received a disproportionate number of citations—4% of AI papers became patents, and 18% went into repositories, yet they have received 29% and 42% of the area’s academic citations, respectively. However, after correcting for papers published at different times with survival analysis, we found that there is a significant time lag between patents or repositories and papers (10-15 years for patents, 5 years for repositories in Computer Vision and NLP, and even longer for top general science journals at 30 years). As for consistent trends, Deep Learning has become exponentially popular, and “papers with code” are becoming the norm. Finally, we showed that a paper’s publication venue and the extent to which a paper builds upon (un)conventional knowledge determine the impact on patents and repositories, with greater conventionality predicting impact on patents, and lesser conventionality predicting impact on repositories.",
          "Privacy is a human right. It ensures that individuals are free to engage in discussions, participate in groups, and form relationships online or offline without fear of their data being inappropriately harvested, analyzed, or otherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a critical factor in research, particularly in the computational social science (CSS), artificial intelligence (AI) and data science domains, given their reliance on individuals' data for novel insights. The increasing use of advanced computational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because, if inappropriately used, they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead to adverse effects for individuals -- especially vulnerable groups -- and society. We have already witnessed a host of privacy issues emerge with the advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which further demonstrate the importance of embedding privacy from the start. This article contributes to the field by discussing the role of privacy and the issues that researchers working in CSS, AI, data science and related domains are likely to face. It then presents several key considerations for researchers to ensure participant privacy is best preserved in their research design, data collection and use, analysis, and dissemination of research results.",
          "One of the primary examples of Web Science is the study of political movements and how they are mediated by the Web in an effort to understand the challenges involved in information-remixing. The lack of transparency around the decisions made during knowledge base creation becomes more pernicious as users move farther away from a single data source where a particular decision can be connected more readily back to its origin. DBpedia and other Web-sourced knowledge bases are extremely useful as a resource for analysis of these issues. These resources are being integrated into text analytics pipelines, which is a key technique for Web science, data science, and computational social science. The lack of transparency can also be solved through careful and extensive forensic work.",
          "&amp;#091;eng&amp;#093;This thesis is devoted to quantitative description, analysis, and modeling of complex social systems in the form of online social networks. Statistical patterns of the systems under study are unveiled and interpreted using concepts and methods of network science, social network analysis, and data mining. A long-term promise of this research is that predicting the behavior of complex techno-social systems will be possible in a way similar to contemporary weather forecasting, using statistical inference and computational modeling based on the advancements in understanding and knowledge of techno-social systems. Although the subject of this study are humans, as opposed to atoms or molecules in statistical physics, the availability of extremely large datasets on human behavior permits the use of tools and techniques of statistical physics. This dissertation deals with large datasets from online social networks, measures statistical patterns of social behavior, and develops quantitative methods, models, and metrics for complex techno-social systems",

          "Abstract The Swiss political system offers researchers in the social sciences a most fruitful context for theoretical and empirical advances in the field of digital democracy. The rich set of political institutions, characterized by a strong interplay of representative and participatory forms of democracy at different levels of the federal state, the multitude of organized political actors, a politically active citizenry, and the widespread use of Internet-based technologies throughout society have led to innovative experimentation with online instruments and processes as well as internationally relevant research. The point of departure arguably lies with Switzerland’s early attempts at introducing Internet voting in referendum votes, followed by election-targeting tools to improve the match between voters and candidates in the form of Voting Advice Applications. With the more recent proliferation of social media and the profound changes in the field of political communication, new research agendas tackle issues such as misinformation, online mobilization, campaigning, and old and new media consumption. Research on digital democracy now makes use of big data, to which constantly evolving methods of computational social sciences can be fruitfully applied. This chapter offers an overview of past and current research efforts in the areas of political communication, elections, and participatory democracy in Switzerland. It also shows how the data-rich Swiss context can inform comparative research, concluding with an outlook of opportunities and challenges that political science faces in the digital era.",
          "As online search and recommendation platforms continue to penetrate all aspects of human decision making, from how we navigate the web to how we socialize and share information, studies detailing their impacts on society are urgently needed. However, identifying and measuring the impact of these platforms poses a challenge, because they are built around existing information ecosystems, rely upon evolving behavioral data, and rarely serve as an individual's sole source of information. As we have seen -- from a man storming a pizzeria with an assault rifle in search of a secret pedophile ring, to a mass shooter citing a web search as the moment he was radicalized online -- severe consequences of these online environments can and do spill over into the real world. Given their ubiquity, research into the influence of these platforms should focus not only on the extent of their impact, but also on developing tools for identifying how, when, and why they produce biased, unjust, or downright false results. Among the most important of such platforms, are web search engines. In this dissertation, I address three questions on the sociopolitical impact of partisanship in web search using an interdisciplinary and mixed-methods approach that includes the psychological, behavioral, political, network, and computational social sciences. In Chapter 1, I provide a brief introduction on the importance of web search and the research presented in this dissertation. In Chapter 2, I provide background information on the psychology of search engine influence, algorithm auditing techniques, and digital trace studies.In Chapter 3, I describe the results from a series of behavioral experiments that examine the impact of partisanship in web search rankings. In Chapter 4, I present results from research involving surveys, human participants, and simulated user activity to examine personalization and partisanship in web search rankings. % and autocomplete search suggestions. In Chapter 5, I present methods for collecting ecologically valid data on partisanship in web search, and report results from two studies. Finally, in Chapter 6, I summarize the contributions, conclusions, and limitations of this dissertation, and make recommendations for future work, which will require more collaborations with subject-matter experts, and greater infrastructure and data sharing.--Author's abstract",
          "Abstract Digital trace data have the potential to offer rich insight into complex behaviors that were once out of reach, but their use has raised vital and unresolved questions about what is—or is not—public opinion. Building on the work of James Bryce, Lindsay Rogers, Herbert Blumer, Paul Lazarsfeld, and more, this essay revisits the discipline’s historical roots and draws parallels between past theory and present practice. Today, scholars treat public opinion as the summation of individual attitudes, weighted equally and expressed anonymously at static points in time through polls, yet prior to the advent of survey research, it was conceived as something intrinsically social and dynamic. In an era dominated by online discussion boards and social media platforms, the insights of this earlier “classical tradition” offer two pathways forward. First, for those who criticize computational social science as poorly theorized, it provides a strong justification for the work that data scientists do in text mining and sentiment analysis. And second, it offers clues for how emerging technologies might be leveraged effectively for the study of public opinion in the future.",
          "\"Man is by nature a political animal\", as asserted by Aristotle. This political nature manifests itself in the data we produce and the traces we leave online. In this tutorial, we address a number of fundamental issues regarding mining of political data: What types of data could be considered political? What can we learn from such data? Can we use the data for prediction of political changes, etc? How can these prediction tasks be done efficiently? Can we use online socio-political data in order to get a better understanding of our political systems and of recent political changes? What are the pitfalls and inherent shortcomings of using online data for political analysis? In recent years, with the abundance of data, these questions, among others, have gained importance, especially in light of the global political turmoil and the upcoming 2016 US presidential election. We introduce relevant political science theory, describe the challenges within the framework of computational social science and present state of the art approaches bridging social network analysis, graph mining, and natural language processing.",
          "Political polarization poses a serious societal challenge around the globe, which has only grown more pronounced with the rise of digital communication. As increasingly central venues for political discourse, social media platforms provide unprecedented opportunities for studying polarization dynamics through unobtrusive observations. Building on prior research that assessed whether social media is polarized and to what extent, this thesis delves into polarized debates to understand how polarization persists and deepens in online discussions. A case study of climate change discussions on Twitter points to information spreading as a crucial reinforcing mechanism of polarization: not only does content circulate primarily within like-minded groups, but the most viral themes also function to enhance ingroup bonds and preclude outgroup engagement. In addition to the empirical analysis, a technical framework is presented for automatically decomposing layers of polarized debates from traces of information diffusion, while its applicability to social media data is systematically evaluated. The second part of this thesis addresses the more challenging question of how polarization can be mitigated. Despite the success of various depolarization experiments, empirical investigation into depolarization on social media remains scarce. To fill this gap, this thesis examines depolarization in real-world settings following cross-party interactions or external threats. The results show limited evidence of depolarization after a cross-party interaction in Reddit political discussions. Even in the face of a substantial external threat, political debates on Twitter were selectively depolarized, with consensus reached among a subset of actors on a subset of arguments. The contribution of this thesis is two-fold. In rendering a realistic depiction of (de)polarized social media discourse, the findings reveal novel insights into the depth of polarization in the system and its striking resilience to depolarization. Through a critical review of the research methods employed, the thesis presents a broader reflection on the merits and limits of observational analysis in computational social science, while underscoring the value of methodological triangulation and integration. In doing so, it not only advances present understandings of political polarization, but also informs future inquiries into the phenomenon.",
          "This study grounded on computational social sciences and social psychology investigated sentiment and life domains, motivational, and temporal themes in social media discussions about robotic technologies. We retrieved text comments from the Reddit social media platform in March 2019 based on the following six robotic technology concepts: robot ( N = 3,433,554), AI ( N = 2,821,614), automation ( N = 879,092), bot ( N = 21,559,939), intelligent agent ( N = 15,119), and software agent ( N = 18,324). The comments were processed using VADER and LIWC text analysis tools and analyzed further with logistic regression models. Compared to the other four concepts, robot and AI were used less often in positive context. Comments addressing themes of leisure, money, and future were associated with positive and home, power, and past with negative comments. The results show how the context and terminology affect the emotionality in robotic technology conversations.",
          "Conversation has long held a place at the center of sociological inquiry. Beginning with Gabriel Tarde's The Laws of Imitation and extending to work on the two-step flow and opinion leadership, talk among citizens has been understood as a key consequence of news exposure and a critical antecedent of opinion formation and political action. Digital media now shifts political talk to online settings, with email, messaging services and social media increasingly central to communication among citizens. To study everyday political talk online, this chapter advances computational social science approaches that combine natural language processing with social network mapping. It illustrates this approach with two case studies of online political talk in response to current events: (1) the verbal attack on Sandra Fluke, a women's rights activist, by Rush Limbaugh on his radio show; and (2) the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen, by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.",
          "QAnon has become an important phenomenon in American politics due to both its relative popularity as well as its adoption/endorsement by political elites. However, this conspiracy theory/social movement has received sparse investigation in the social sciences. This gap is particularly noticeable in regards to the QAnon movement’s overall beliefs and perceptions of global affairs. This piece addresses these research gaps by using repeatable inductive computational social science methods to analyze a sample of comments from YouTube, a platform popular with QAnon followers. This investigation affirms previous observations regarding QAnon’s narratives connecting the U.S. government (particularly prominent Democrats) and alleged sexual violence against children, anti-semitism/fundamentalist Christian theology, and pro-Trump sentiments, and also reaveals several novel conclusions regarding QAnon. These novel observations include: [1] that the QAnon community sustains substantial discussion of international affairs, largely revolving around China, Russia and Israel (in order of prominence); [2] that discussion of China in QAnon comments received more “likes” than other international topics; and [3] that a nexus of conjectures tying former presidential candidate, Senator, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the Chinese party-state dominate these China-centric comments. Aside from these novel conclusions regarding QAnon, this paper also seeks to make a contribution to repeatable social science analysis of YouTube comments more generally.",
          "Abstract This systematic review synthesizes research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to explore the reasons behind dissent regarding their existence, antecedents, and effects. It provides a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations, analyzing how measurement approaches and contextual factors influence outcomes. The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North. Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EU’s Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.",
          "Since its creation in 2006, Twitter became an essential support for researchers in computer science and computational social science, especially for those working on political issues. This talk will present a panorama of its uses on this domain. Using works on political polarization, stance detection, election prediction, and political engagement, we will look at the technical choices made to take advantage of Twitter data and at the insights they gave on various political landscapes and political actors, from strategies to avoid confrontations in debates on gun control in the US to relations between factions in an Italian political party.",
          "The proliferation of digital media platforms has fundamentally transformed the ways individuals consume information and form opinions. This study examined the role of echo chambers, filter bubbles, and selective exposure in shaping user perceptions and opinion polarization within online environments. Using a quantitative survey approach, data were collected from 450 active social media users to investigate patterns of content consumption, perceived algorithmic influence, and the relationship between selective exposure and opinion formation. Findings indicated that a significant majority of participants were frequently exposed to ideologically consonant content, demonstrating the prevalence of echo chambers and algorithmically curated filter bubbles. High levels of selective exposure were positively associated with increased opinion polarization, suggesting that repeated engagement with like-minded content reinforced existing beliefs and limited exposure to divergent perspectives. Perceived algorithmic influence varied among users, highlighting the moderating role of human agency in navigating content personalization. The study concluded that both structural mechanisms, such as algorithmic recommendations, and behavioural patterns, such as selective exposure, jointly contributed to ideological reinforcement in digital spaces. Implications for media literacy, platform design, and policy interventions were discussed, emphasizing the importance of fostering informational diversity to mitigate polarization. This research provides empirical evidence on the dynamics of opinion formation in digitally mediated spaces and offers guidance for strategies aimed at promoting inclusive and balanced discourse in online communities.

          "Significance Popular wisdom suggests that the internet plays a major role in influencing people’s attitudes and behaviors related to politics, such as by providing slanted sources of information. Yet evidence for this proposition is elusive due to methodological difficulties and the multifaceted nature of online media effects. This study breaks ground by demonstrating a nudge-like approach for exploring these effects through a combination of real-world experimentation and computational social science techniques. The results confirm that it is difficult for people to be persuaded by competing media accounts during a contentious election campaign. At the same time, data from a longer time span suggest that the real consequence of online partisan media may be an erosion of trust in mainstream news.",
          "A number of models and techniques has been proposed for predicting the outcomes of presidential elections. Some of them use information on the socio-economical status of a country, others focus on candidates' popularity measures in news media. We employ a computational social science approach, utilising public reactions in social media to real-life events that involve presidential candidates. Contrary to the popular approach, we do not analyse public emotions but ethotic references to the character of politicians which allows us to analyse how much they are (dis-)trusted by the general public, hence the name of the tool we developed: Trust Analytics (TrustAn). Similarly to major news media's polls, we observe a tight race between Harris and Trump with week to week changes in the level of trust and distrust towards the two candidates. Using the ratio between the level of trust and distrust towards them and changes of this metric in time, we predict Donald Trump as the winner of the US 2024 elections.",
          "Abstract This chapter argues that social media drives change by allowing new “tiny acts” of political participation in support of a social or political cause, such as sharing, liking, viewing, or following. While most of these “microdonations” of time and effort rapidly decay, they occasionally and unpredictably scale up to massive support for a political or social movement campaigning for policy change. Drawing on their computational social science research, the authors see that such mobilizations bring turbulence to contemporary politics. The findings reveal social media platforms as important actors in contemporary politics, shaping political behavior and the practice of politics, challenging political institutions and requiring new political science concepts and research methods.",
          "This study investigates the strategic role of disinformation in exacerbating political polarization and eroding civic trust in the United States. In the context of increasing ideological fragmentation and declining institutional legitimacy, the paper aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding how disinformation, both foreign and domestic, functions as a systematic tool of democratic destabilization. The study synthesizes existing theoretical and empirical literature from political science, media studies and computational social science. This paper draws on secondary data, content analyses and findings from peer-reviewed studies to explore five core dimensions: the theoretical foundations of political polarization in the U.S., the structural design of disinformation ecosystems, cognitive mechanisms underlying belief formation, digital media architectures and algorithmic amplification and institutional responses aimed at democratic resilience. The findings reveal that algorithmically driven digital platforms disproportionately amplify partisan and emotionally charged content; however, cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and motivated reasoning make individuals more susceptible to politically aligned disinformation. The study also highlights how foreign actors exploit domestic vulnerabilities through computational propaganda and how domestic political actors weaponize disinformation to manipulate public opinion and suppress dissent. Institutional responses such as fact-checking and media literacy programs, though valuable, remain insufficient in the absence of systemic platform reform and coordinated governance mechanisms. The paper, therefore, concludes that disinformation operates not merely as a crisis of information accuracy but as an epistemic threat to democratic deliberation. Addressing this challenge requires an integrated strategy that combines policy, technology, education, and civic renewal.",
          "This systematic review investigates how the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been strategically communicated and mediatized across Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Drawing on peer-reviewed journal articles, policy reports, and regional media analyses published between 2013 and 2025, the study synthesizes existing scholarship on message framing, narrative construction, political communication strategies, and media–state dynamics related to the BRI. The review identifies three major research strands: (1) government-led strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts shaping the BRI discourse; (2) media framing practices that reflect national interests, geopolitical tensions, and societal perceptions within CEE countries; and (3) the mediatization processes through which political, economic, and cultural narratives surrounding the BRI become embedded in domestic and transnational communication systems. The findings reveal persistent discrepancies between official narratives and media framings, significant variation across CEE countries, and the growing influence of digital media ecosystems in shaping BRI-related public opinion. The review also highlights methodological gaps and suggests future research directions, including comparative multimodal communication analysis and the integration of computational social science approaches.",
          "This paper explores the intersection of digital communication, youth activism and national security, drawing on the case of the 2024/2025 Gen-Z protests in Kenya. Beginning with protests against the Finance Bill 2024, these protests quickly became the most widespread youth mobilization and protest in Kenyan history since the early 1900s. Social media platforms served as mobilization venues on one side and contest venues on the other. The research builds on the theory of securitization and the notion of networked publics to construct a Digital Securitization Cascade, aiming to understand how viral online communication both inflates and limits states’ responses to dissent. The methodological approach involves a convergent mixed-methods design, combining computational social science and qualitative methods, including network analysis and cross-platform content time-series modelling, with critical discourse analysis of government statements, media attention and 25 semi-structured interviews with activists, journalists, and policymakers. Results indicate that surges in online presence were powerful predictors of securitizing rhetoric by state actors, and viral transmission of visual representations of police violence created international suspicion, which softened coercive state strategies. At the same time, misinformation and disinformation also made it difficult to trust any side of the protesters or the government, provoking further conflict online. It contributes in 3 ways: theoretically, the study is a reconceptualization of securitization as a digitally networked public contest into a large-scale form of mobilization; empirically, the study presents a rare example of a large-scale mobilization of youth in East Africa; and methodologically, the study is a multimodal approach to the study of protest communication in the Global South. The article concludes by offering policy recommendations on the governance of platforms, transparency in the security sector and youth empowerment in democratic processes.",
          "Longstanding theory indicates the threat of a common enemy can mitigate conflict between members of rival groups. We tested this hypothesis in a pre-registered experiment where 1,670 Republicans and Democrats in the United States were asked to complete a collaborative online task with an automated agent or “bot” that was labelled as a member of the opposing party. Prior to this task, we exposed respondents to primes about a) a common enemy (involving threats from Iran, China, and Russia); b) a patriotic event; or c) a neutral, apolitical prime. Though we observed no significant differences in the behavior of Democrats as a result of these primes, we found that Republicans—and particularly those with very strong conservative views—were significantly less likely to cooperate with Democrats when primed about a common enemy. We also observed lower rates of cooperation among Republicans who participated in our study during the 2020 Iran crisis, which occurred in the middle of our fieldwork. These findings indicate common enemies may not reduce inter-group conflict in highly polarized societies, and contribute to a growing number of studies that find evidence of asymmetric political polarization. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for research in social psychology, political conflict, and the rapidly expanding field of computational social science.",
          "Reddit, one of the largest global social media platforms, has undergone significant transformations since its inception in 2005. From a loosely structured, niche platform to a globally recognized company with a standardized and regulated governance system, Reddit’s evolution has been marked by a shift in the power dynamics between its owners, moderators, and users. 2015 and 2023 were marked by the occurrence of two prominent protests, termed “blackouts.” Moderators of numerous subreddits, though not all, disabled public access to their subreddits, thereby protesting the company’s policies and policy changes and challenging the company’s endeavors to exert further control over the platform. Drawing on Bourdieusian theory and relational methodology, we establish a computational social science approach to investigate the structural causes behind the two blackouts and contextualize the differences between them. We argue that these blackouts signify growing tensions within the socio-technical space of Reddit and an ongoing political, cultural, and economic reconfiguration of its power structure and political economy.",

          "Election prediction has long been an evergreen in political science literature. Traditionally, such efforts included polling aggregates, economic indicators, partisan affiliation, and campaign effects to predict aggregate voting outcomes. With increasing secondary usage of online-generated data in social science, researchers have begun to consult metadata from widely used web-based platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Trends and Wikipedia to calibrate forecasting models. Web-based platforms offer the means for voters to retrieve detailed campaign-related information, and for researchers to study the popularity of campaigns and public sentiment surrounding them. However, past contributions have often overlooked the interaction between conventional election variables and information-seeking behaviour patterns. In this work, we aim to unify traditional and novel methodology by considering how information retrieval differs between incumbent and challenger campaigns, as well as the effect of perceived candidate viability and media coverage on Wikipedia's predictive ability. In order to test our hypotheses, we use election data from United States Congressional (Senate and House) elections between 2016 and 2018. We demonstrate that Wikipedia data, as a proxy for information-seeking behaviour patterns, is particularly useful for predicting the success of well-funded challengers who are relatively less prevalent in the media. In general, our findings underline the importance of a mixed-data approach to predictive analytics in computational social science.",
          "Agreements and disagreements are part of our social interactions. While there is a main consensus that disagreements are essential for our democratic coexistence, recent political events make us question whether systematic disagreements in the population lead to a more polarized society than in the past. Therefore, identifying to what extent our society is polarized is an important issue to be tackled nowadays. As most studies in this discipline speak to the U.S. system, we visualize an opportunity to use computer science techniques to contribute with new agnostic approaches and novel datasets that allow us to quantify and study divisiveness and polarization around the world and over time. This dissertation systematically assesses measures of agreement, divisiveness, and polarization in society, specifically during elections. We present a collection of three empirical chapters that demonstrate the potential of data collected through online platforms and election outcomes as reliable forms to capture citizen division and polarization. This work is primarily interdisciplinary, aiming to contribute to the growing computational social science community. Our main contribution includes two methodological proposals for mapping the divisiveness of issues and levels of polarization in society. First, we report the findings of two digital democracy systems released by our team in France and Brazil preceding their respective 2022 presidential elections. We used the data collected to introduce a metric of divisiveness that is agnostic to aggregation functions and can map divisive issues. We demonstrated that the values of our measure for divisiveness are uncorrelated to the one obtained from its respective aggregation function, and these results are generalized both for political and non-political datasets and for synthetic and real data. Second, motivated by recent unexpected election outcomes around the world, we coined the term Election Polarization (EP) to refer to the division level of citizens on Election Day. We split our definition into two dimensions: competitiveness (Between-EP) and geographical divisions (Within-EP). To assess the EP, we propose a method that relies exclusively on election data. Using synthetic and presidential election data from France, Chile, and the United States, our results suggest that we can know whether an election is polarized by simply knowing whether two conditions are satisfied: greater participation levels and voting patterns clustered by regions. Our concluding contribution analyzes the data collected by our experimental digital democracy systems to determine to what extent contentious issues and the user interface condition citizen involvement in an anonymous setup and, consequently, collective decisions. Our motivation came from the hypothesis that individuals in face-to-face discussions prefer not to talk about contentious issues in order to avoid confrontations. We found that merely reading a divisive issue in the early stages of participation did not increase the dropout. Then, by borrowing measures of carelessness from behavioral studies, we show that the demographic characteristics of participants are associated with traditional measures of careless participation. For instance, female participants (a minoritarian group that represented around 30% of the participants in our platforms) abstained at a higher rate than male participants by responding to approval ballots. This posits evidence that just removing careless participants without any context (for instance, using the naïve approach of removing abstentions) exacerbates disparities in the representation of men/women or young/old in digital democracy setups.",
          "This presentation has a twofold objective. Substantively, we revisit a longstanding question using computational social science tools: Do people learn about politics through news exposure? To overcome the limitations of traditional self-reported exposure measures, we rely on exogenous (i.e., observed) measures of exposure. Methodologically, we validate several exogenous exposure measures that vary in granularity. Using machine learning techniques, we develop exposure metrics ranging from domain-level visits to specific content interactions. We assess these measures through multiple approaches, including their ability to predict political knowledge on an unexpected news event— the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our findings highlight the importance of granularity: only visits and time spent on Ukraine-related articles significantly predict event knowledge, whereas broader measures—such as domain-level visits—show no effect when controlling for self-reported exposure and other key predictors.",
          "Abstract Electronic petitions can serve as an influential mechanism for political participation. We present a study on the dynamics in the German e‐petition system which was introduced in late 2008. Drawing on a data set of signatures, we analyze four aspects: (a) the types of petitions found, (b) the temporal dynamics of petitions, (c) the types of users found, and (d) the intersection of different petitions' supporter populations. We present evidence that (a) the system is dominated by a very small number of high‐volume petitions and (b) these high‐volume petitions have a delayed boosting effect on the base activity in the petition system. We furthermore (c) present a typology of users, showing that although highly active “new lobbyists” and “hit‐and‐run activists” exist, one‐ or two‐time petitioners have the largest impact. Finally, it is indicated that (d) many of the high‐volume petitions share a significant part of their user base, hinting at a complex, topically motivated network of supporters. Through the application of methods from what has been called “Computational Social Sciences,” we illuminate a highly relevant field of political behavior online, while demonstrating the capability of data‐driven approaches in such novel domains.",
          "Recent years have witnessed an increased public outcry in certain quarters about a perceived lack of attention given to successful members of disadvantaged groups relative to equally meritorious members of advantaged groups, exemplified by social media campaigns centered around hashtags, such as #OscarsSoWhite and #WomenAlsoKnowStuff. Focusing on political ideology, we investigate here whether individuals differentially amplify successful targets depending on whether these targets belong to disadvantaged or advantaged groups, behavior that could help alleviate or entrench group-based disparities. Study 1 examines over 500,000 tweets from over 160,000 Twitter users about 46 unambiguously successful targets varying in race (white, black) and gender (male, female): American gold medalists from the 2016 Olympics. Leveraging advances in computational social science, we identify tweeters' political ideology, race, and gender. Tweets from political liberals were much more likely than those from conservatives to be about successful black (vs. white) and female (vs. male) gold medalists (and especially black females), controlling for tweeters' own race and gender, and even when tweeters themselves were white or male (i.e., advantaged group members). Studies 2 and 3 provided experimental evidence that liberals are more likely than conservatives to differentially amplify successful members of disadvantaged (vs. advantaged) groups and suggested that this is driven by liberals' heightened concern with social equality. Addressing theorizing about ideological asymmetries, we observed that political liberals are more responsible than conservatives for differential amplification. Our results highlight ideology's polarizing power to shape even whose accomplishments we promote, and extend theorizing about behavioral manifestations of egalitarian motives.",
          "This dissertation contributes to a better understanding of how consciously users of social media perceive their online environment. A special focus of two of my projects is on the perception of the political orientation of the online environment, its determinants, and possible distortion factors. This work is based on the assumption that people’s awareness of their online environment is dependent on a correct retrieval of their network on the one hand, and on an accurate assessment of these resources in terms of their political orientation on the other. Therefore, I first examine these basic assumptions in two projects, while a third project finally measures the awareness of one’s environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All presented projects use online surveys to collect empirical data and are based on the analysis of digital trace data. This dissertation, therefore, combines classical elements of empirical social science with novel methods of computer science in the new research field that is Computational Social Science. This work contributes substantially to theoretical considerations from social psychology, political science, and methodological social research. The present study shows to what extent people can recapitulate their behavior on social media, how the political orientation of their network and that of third parties is evaluated, and which cognitive mechanisms cause a distorted perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first project, I lay the grounds for the other projects by comparing the reported values of a reliably measurable variable (Twitter activity in the form of the number of most recently posted messages on Twitter, as well as the number of friends on Twitter) to their observed values. The aim of this work is to gain a basic intuition for the accuracy of self-reported values regarding one’s own online behavior and thus to contribute to research regarding survey methodology. In general, the results indicate a low accuracy of the Twitter users’ perception of their Twitter activity. Furthermore, there seem to be differences in response behavior according to social group membership and recruitment context. This project contributes to recently published research on distorted response behavior when reporting online activity (Guess et al., 2019; Henderson et al., 2019) and sets the framework for the validity of the results of the other projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awareness of online media environments, however, not only depends on remembering one’s own social network as accurately as possible but also on correctly assessing the political orientation of the individual sources. The second project contributes to the literature on the perception of political news distortions (e.g., Vallone, Ross and Leeper, 1985; Gunther, 1992) by evaluating in a conjoint experiment (Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2014) the general ability of Internet users to recognize the ideological direction of hypothetical Twitter networks. The results suggest that conservative Internet users estimate the correct political alignment of liberal Twitter networks less accurately than congenial Twitter networks. This project also contributes to research on media literacy (e.g., van der Meer and Hameleers, 2020) by measuring normative views on the diversity of subscribed media content. Overall, participants in my study generally prefer a political diversification of Twitter networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the last project measures the awareness of Twitter users for the political attitudes of their own Twitter environment and is thus at the heart of the topic of this dissertation. By comparing perceptions of their own Twitter network with estimates obtained with the method developed by Barberá (2015), I show that there is a basic intuition for the political attitudes of their own environment. However, the political attitudes of social media users distort the accuracy of this awareness by overestimating the percentage of Twitter friends who have the same political attitude as the user herself, while political knowledge helps to determine the correct political orientation of one’s own Twitter environment more accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dissertation investigates online media consumption within the framework of social science hypotheses using a variety of modern survey and recruitment methods as well as innovative tools from the field of computer science. The results of the second and third projects suggest that Internet users have a basic sense of the political inclination of online actors. However, the results of the first and third projects also clearly show that there is a general uncertainty regarding their own online activities. With the analyses of cognitive mechanisms in the second and third projects and the collection of normative views on online news consumption in the second project, my results contribute to explaining this discrepancy between presumed and actual behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;References:&lt;br /&gt;Barberá, Pablo. 2015. “Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together: Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data.” Political Analysis 23:76–91.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess, Andrew, Kevin Munger, Jonathan Nagler and Joshua Tucker. 2019. “How Accurate Are Survey Responses on Social Media and Politics.” Political Communication 36(2):241–258.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunther, Albert C. 1992. “Biased Press or Biased Public?

          "US presidential candidates have been using campaign websites since 1996 and social-networking sites since 2004, but little research has compared the content of these candidates' online messages to the content of their messages on other channels. political communication scholars have analyzed campaign messages in speeches, debates, ads, and online content by categorizing their tone as either positive, negative, or mixed/contrast, and by categorizing their content as focused on either issues (policies) or image (character) traits. To access the tweets, this chapter utilizes the Twitter Data Collection and Analysis tool on the Data-driven Computational Social Science (DD-CSS) website to download the candidates' Twitter posts over the course of the primary campaign. Once the Twitter, debate, and speech transcripts were gathered and prepared, they were analyzed by DICTION® software, a computer-assisted text analysis (CATA) program that searches for more than 10,000 words, sorts them into 35 categories, and calculates five master variables.",
          "This folder contains the replication files for the paper “Channelling Hearts and Minds: Advocacy Organizations, Cognitive-Emotional Currents, and Public Conversation” by Christopher A. Bail, Taylor Brown, and Marcus Mann, which appears in the American Sociological Review, 2017. These data describe the social media outreach of 82 autism and organ donation advocacy organizations on Facebook between 2011-2012 collected via a social media application that collected public and non-public data from the Facebook Application Programming Interface and surveyed representatives of the organization in order to obtain additional information on the size, resources, and tactics of the organization as it attempts to generate attention for its cause on social media. ABSTRACT OF ARTICLE: Do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social problems by engaging in rational debate, or by appealing to emotions? We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These “cognitive-emotional currents” create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We evaluate this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing non-public data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation, how social contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational social science.",
          "This article suggests a new methodological model for the study of hybrid media events with global appeal. This model, developed in the project on the 2015 &lt;em&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/em&gt; attacks in Paris, was created specifically for researching digital media—and in particular, Twitter. The article is structured as follows. Firstly, the methodological scope is discussed against the theoretical context, e.g. the theory of media events. In the theoretical discussion, special emphasis is given to i) disruptive, upsetting, or disintegrative media events and hybrid media events and ii) the conditions of today’s heterogeneous and globalised media communication landscape. Secondly, the article introduces a multi-method approach developed for the analysis of hybrid media events. In this model, computational social science—namely, automated content analysis (ACA) and social network analytics (SNA)—are combined with a qualitative approach—specifically, digital ethnography. The article outlines three key phases for research in which the interplay between quantitative and qualitative approaches is played out. In the first phase, preliminary digital ethnography is applied to provide the outline of the event. In the second phase, quantitative social network analytics are applied to construct the digital field for research. In this phase, it is necessary to map a) what is circulating on the websites and b) where this circulation takes place. The third and final phase applies a qualitative approach and digital ethnography to provide a more nuanced, in-depth interpretation of what (substance/content) is circulating and how this material connects with the ‘where’ in the digital landscape, hence constituting links and connections in the hybrid media landscape. In conclusion, the article reflects on how this multi-method approach contributes to understanding the workings of today’s hybrid media events: how they create and maintain symbolic battles over certain imagined constructs of social imaginaries of solidarity, belonging, contestation, and exclusion, a topic of core value for the theory of media events.",

          "This study explores the interplay of issue salience and affective signals in Swiss public reactions to government measures on the Reddit forum r/Switzerland during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Using an Exploratory Data Analysis approach, this study applied topic modeling (BERTopic) to a large corpus of posts (2019-2022) to identify shifts in online public attention and emotional responses, and transformer-based sentiment and emotion analysis to quantify sentimentand discrete emotions as affectives. The results reveal a Swiss online public that is highly responsive to events, with attention shifting rapidly, and whose discourse is deeply imbued with emotional content, predominantly negative in the face of restrictive policies or unsettling international developments. These insights underscore the value of computational social science in unpacking the complexities of online public opinion and offer a foundation for future research into the evolving nature of digital democracy and crisis governance.",

          "This systematic review synthesizes research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to explore the reasons behind dissent regarding their existence, antecedents, and effects. It provides a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations, analyzing how measurement approaches and contextual factors influence outcomes. The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North. Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EUs Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.",
          "The rise of political polarization within western societies has been portrayed by events such as the United States Capitol riot or the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. In this context, we argue that computational social science (CSS) methods offer a scalable and language-independent fashion to measure political polarization, enabling the processing of big data. In this vein, this article offers the first scoping review of the application of CSS methods to analyzing political polarization through text as data. We propose a categorization framework and reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of the different models used in the literature. Additionally, we underline the importance of filling research gaps, such as considering the temporal characteristic of political polarization, using a mathematical approach to analyze the use cases, and avoiding location and platform bias. We also provide recommendations for future research.",
          "This short survey paper attempts to provide an overview of the most recent research works on the popular politics domain within the framework of the Twitter social network. Given both the political turmoil that arouse at the end of 2016 and early 2017, and the increasing popularity of social networks in general, and Twitter, in particular, we feel that this topic forms an attractive candidate for fellow data mining researchers that came into sight over the last few months. Herein, we start by presenting a brief overview of our motivation and continue with basic information on the Twitter platform, which constitutes two clearly identifiable components, namely as an online news source and as one of the most popular social networking sites. Focus is then given to research works dealing with sentiment analysis in political topics and opinion polls, whereas we continue by reviewing the Twittersphere from the computational social science point of view, by including behavior analysis, social interaction and social influence identification methods and by discerning and discriminating its useful types within the social network, thus envisioning possible further utilization scenarios for the collected information. A short discussion on the identified conclusions and a couple of future research directions concludes the survey.",
          "Significance Social media provide potent opportunities for advocacy organizations to shape public debates because of the rapidly increasing number of people who frequent such forums each day. However, social scientists have not yet explained why some advocacy organizations create large-scale public debate whereas most others do not. Using automated text analysis and a Facebook application, I found that advocacy organizations are more likely to stimulate conversation if they produce messages that link discursive themes that are usually discussed in isolation from each other. Such messages not only resonate with multiple audiences, but also put such audiences in conversation with each other. This manuscript thereby contributes a theory of public deliberation on social media for the emerging field of computational social science.",
          "There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating \"echo chambers\" that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for one month that exposed them to messages produced by elected officials, organizations, and other opinion leaders with opposing political ideologies. Respondents were re-surveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative post-treatment, and Democrats who followed a conservative Twitter bot became slightly more liberal post-treatment. These findings have important implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization as well as the emerging field of computational social science.",
          "Significance Social media sites are often blamed for exacerbating political polarization by creating “echo chambers” that prevent people from being exposed to information that contradicts their preexisting beliefs. We conducted a field experiment that offered a large group of Democrats and Republicans financial compensation to follow bots that retweeted messages by elected officials and opinion leaders with opposing political views. Republican participants expressed substantially more conservative views after following a liberal Twitter bot, whereas Democrats’ attitudes became slightly more liberal after following a conservative Twitter bot—although this effect was not statistically significant. Despite several limitations, this study has important implications for the emerging field of computational social science and ongoing efforts to reduce political polarization online.",

          "Digital media platforms have transformed how societies encounter, evaluate, and act upon information. Yet the infrastructures that govern this visibility, eg, search engines and social media feeds, operate through algorithmic systems that selectively surface, rank, and frame content. This dissertation investigates how those systems mediate public knowledge in the post-API era, when direct access to platform data has been sharply restricted. It asks two linked questions: (1) Can search engines be treated as observational proxies for social media data? and (2) How do their ranking and framing choices influence user understanding and behavior? The theoretical framework joins two literatures: algorithmic gatekeeping, which treats ranking and recommendation as infrastructures of visibility, and framing theory, which explains how linguistic and structural cues shape cognition. Together they suggest that digital intermediaries do not merely transmit information, they construct the epistemic environment in which facts, controversies, and communities become perceptible. The dissertation therefore conceptualizes search engines as dual mediators: instruments that shape both the empirical data available to researchers and the interpretive frames available to users. This thesis argues that search engines systematically distort the informational landscape. Their curation amplifies popular and positively valenced content while suppressing the controversial, explicit, conspiratorial, and politically charged; moreover, the framing of what is shown guides user attention and steers subsequent searches. These two forms of mediation—structural and cognitive—jointly compromise the reliability of search engines as research proxies and magnify their power as shapers of public discourse. Empirical analyses across four studies substantiate this claim. Large-scale comparisons between Google's Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and ground-truth datasets from Reddit and Twitter/X reveal extensive topical and sentiment gaps: SERPs overrepresent high-engagement and neutral material while omitting entire communities and issue clusters. A second line of work shows that Google's ranking of hashtags and subreddits privileges visible, low-toxicity spaces and filters out sexual, conspiratorial, and crypto-related content, confirming the gatekeeping hypothesis. Cross-engine audits of Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo demonstrate systematic differences in ideological bias and factuality, with Google favoring left-leaning, higher-factuality sources and Bing favoring right-leaning ones. Finally, controlled behavioral experiments establish that brief exposure to framed headlines measurably redirects follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames induce polarized search trajectories, while thematic frames promote analytic engagement. Taken together, these findings portray search engines as epistemic infrastructures whose curation and framing co-produce the boundaries of what can be known. By mapping both the methodological distortion and the behavioral consequence of algorithmic mediation, this dissertation contributes to computational social science, information retrieval, and political communication, and argues for treating search transparency not merely as a technical issue but as a condition of democratic knowledge.",
          "Is there something akin to geopolitics for online communities? One could think of communities as nations formed around shared interests of individual users. Friendly borders capture similar interests, but conflicts could emerge due to ideological differences or competition for attention (as for land). Over time, new coalitions could emerge, others could crumble, and many could disappear as casualties of online wars with highly unpredictable and often devastating outcomes. The r/place experiment is the most ingenious attempt at reproducing this complex collective dynamics as a series of three social games hosted by Reddit. The result is not only an accurate picture of the diverse interests on Reddit -- one of the most popular social media platforms in the world -- but also fine-grained traces of sequential actions taken by millions of players during the game. In this paper, we are the first to characterize the collective behavior during r/place in terms of engagement, collaboration, and competition using tools from computational social science and data science. Our analysis shows that r/place reflected many patterns found in other relevant group decision-making processes, including empirical evidence for group coordination costs, social loafing, and increased cooperation as a response to competition. We discuss how our findings can support the development of new theoretical models, tools, and mechanisms to optimize collaborative-competitive processes in social networks.",
          "Abstract In Congressional hearings, opinion articles, and Netflix documentaries, social media platforms are routinely blamed for deepening polarization and harming mental health. In our conclusion, we relate the book’s main arguments to these kinds of concerns. There are reasons to be critical, but it matters how we are critical. Sweeping critiques risk reifying social media, seeing them as evil actors rather than as vectors in broader sets of relations. Our relational and contextual approach makes it difficult to arrive at a definitive verdict, but it allows us to understand why social media’s impacts vary so widely between users, places, and groups. Finally, we explore the broader epistemological implications of our study, and outline how we might bring meaning, context, and power into computational social science.",
          "With the rise of computational social science, many scholars utilize data analysis and natural language processing tools to analyze social media, news articles, and other accessible data sources for examining political and social discourse. Particularly, the study of the emergence of echo-chambers due to the dissemination of specific information has become a topic of interest in mixed methods research areas. In this paper, we analyze data collected from two news portals, Breitbart News (BN) and New York Times (NYT) to prove the hypothesis that the formation of echo-chambers can be partially explained on the level of an individual information consumption rather than a collective topology of individuals' social networks. Our research findings are presented through knowledge graphs, utilizing a dataset spanning 11.5 years gathered from BN and NYT media portals. We demonstrate that the application of knowledge representation techniques to the aforementioned news streams highlights, contrary to common assumptions, shows relative \"internal\" neutrality of both sources and polarizing attitude towards a small fraction of entities. Additionally, we argue that such characteristics in information sources lead to fundamental disparities in audience worldviews, potentially acting as a catalyst for the formation of echo-chambers.",
          "This article explores the newspaper discourse surrounding a paradigm shift in social policy. The case at hand, Germany, is a prime example of a welfare state that was particularly resistant to reform. Hence, the rapid paradigm shift in German family policy since the late 1990s is puzzling. This study seeks to resolve this puzzle by drawing on the insight that public discourse is crucial for policy change. Politicians have to promote reforms prior to their implementation. The main channel for communication with the wider public is the mass media. I use newspaper coverage from 1990 to 2016 to analyze whether the media is responsive to reform initiatives. I use topic modeling, an innovative method from the computational social sciences (CSS), to identify dominant themes and shifts over time in a large corpus of newspaper articles (N = 1,459). The analysis shows that public discourse was responsive to the parliamentary debate. The article also clarifies the role of critical events and identifies discursive strategies.",
          "This thesis investigates the role of network structure, brokerage, and framing in high-risk collective action. I use the protest movement that emerged in Russia following falsified national elections in 2011 and 2012 as an empirical case study. I draw on a unique dataset of nearly 30,000 online documents and the linking structure of over 3,500 Russian Web sites. I employ a range of computational social science methods, including Exponential Random Graph Modeling, an advanced statistical model for social networks, social network analysis, machine learning, and latent semantic analysis. I address three research questions in this thesis. The first asks if a protest network challenging a hybrid regime will have a polycentric or hierarchical structure, and if that structure changes over time. Polycentric networks are conducive to high-risk collective action and are robust to the targeted removal of key nodes, while hierarchical networks can more easily mobilize protesters and spread information. I find that the Russian protest network has a polycentric structure only at the beginning of the protests, and moves towards a less effective hierarchical structure as the movement loses popular support. The second research question seeks to understand if brokered text is actually novel, and if that text is more novel in polycentric networks than in hierarchical ones. Brokers are the individuals or nodes in a network that connect disparate groups through weak ties and close structural holes. Brokers are advantageous because they have access to and spread novel information. I find that the text among nodes in brokered relationships is indeed novel, but that information novelty decreases when networks have a hierarchical structure. The last research question asks if a protest movement in a high-risk political setting can be more successful than the government at spreading its preferred frames, and within such a movement, whether moderate or extremist framing is more prevalent. I find that the opposition is far more effective than the government in spreading its frames, even when the government organizes massive counter protests. Within the movement, moderates are more likely to have their framing adopted online than extremists, unless violence occurs at protests. The findings suggest that movements should build flatter, more diffuse networks by ensuring that brokers tie together diverse protest constituencies. The findings also provide evidence against those who claim that authoritarian governments are more effective in shaping online discourse than oppositional movements, and also suggest that movements should advance moderate framing in order to attract a wider base of support among the general population.",
          "The \"RightNets\" dataset presented in this paper was collected within the framework of the RightNets project, focusing on digital campaigning during the six months leading up to the 2024 European elections in Italy. It encompasses 10,000 tweets and 411 Facebook posts, systematically gathered to analyze online political dynamics. For each tweet, the dataset records its unique ID, engagement metrics-including retweet, reply, like, and quote counts-and timestamps, along with attributes identifying retweets, replies, or quotes. Similarly, the Facebook dataset includes post metadata such as unique ID and engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments, as well as posting dates. The data was collected using automated tools that targeted specific election-related hashtags, ensuring a focus on relevant political content. The dataset is hosted in a GitHub repository, providing accessibility and fostering reproducibility. By emphasizing transparency, it allows researchers to study key dimensions of digital campaigning, such as engagement patterns, the spread of misinformation, and the potential for foreign interference. The granular details enable analysis of voter interaction trends and candidate accountability across platforms. Furthermore, its design supports interdisciplinary research, with applications in political science, law, and computational social science. The dataset holds significant potential for reuse, serving as a benchmark for longitudinal studies, a foundation for computational model development, and a resource for comparative analyses across elections and countries. It is a tool for exploring the complexities of modern digital political communication and for informing regulatory measures to enhance the fairness of online electoral processes.",
          "In local and global contexts, the link between individual news consumption and beneficial or harmful effects is debated. Some communication theories posit that individuals must stay up-to-date with news to make civic choices like voting, volunteering, and participating in community organizing. Nonetheless, there is increasing evidence that overuse or overreliance on news can have harmful effects on mental health and lead to news avoidance. In a contested and polarized news landscape, understanding how individuals can sustain productive, healthy engagement with civic information is vital. In my work, I draw on literature in the communication and journalism fields to understand the impact of shifting media ecosystems on individuals. My studies employ methods from computational social science and human-computer interaction to analyze news content and exposure in more nuanced ways than previously available. I outline my agenda to run experiments to identify risk-benefit trade-offs at the individual level for engaging with evolving technological news systems.",
          "Within the context of partisan selective exposure and attitude polarization, this study investigates a mutually reinforcing spiral model, aiming to clarify mechanisms and boundary conditions that affect spiral processes—interpersonal agreement and disagreement, and the ebb and flow of message receptions. Utilizing agent-based modeling (Abm) simulations, the study formally models endogenous dynamics of cumulative processes and its reciprocal effect of media choice behavior over extended periods of time. Our results suggest that interpersonal discussion networks, in conjunction with election contexts, condition the reciprocal effect of selective media exposure and its attitudinal consequences. Methodologically, results also highlight the analytical utility of computational social science approaches in overcoming the limitations of typical experimental and observations studies.",
          "This study investigates the strategic role of disinformation in exacerbating political polarization and eroding civic trust in the United States. In the context of increasing ideological fragmentation and declining institutional legitimacy, the paper aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding how disinformation, both foreign and domestic, functions as a systematic tool of democratic destabilization. The study synthesizes existing theoretical and empirical literature from political science, media studies and computational social science. This paper draws on secondary data, content analyses and findings from peer-reviewed studies to explore five core dimensions: the theoretical foundations of political polarization in the U.S., the structural design of disinformation ecosystems, cognitive mechanisms underlying belief formation, digital media architectures and algorithmic amplification and institutional responses aimed at democratic resilience. The findings reveal that algorithmically driven digital platforms disproportionately amplify partisan and emotionally charged content; however, cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and motivated reasoning make individuals more susceptible to politically aligned disinformation. The study also highlights how foreign actors exploit domestic vulnerabilities through computational propaganda and how domestic political actors weaponize disinformation to manipulate public opinion and suppress dissent. Institutional responses such as fact-checking and media literacy programs, though valuable, remain insufficient in the absence of systemic platform reform and coordinated governance mechanisms. The paper, therefore, concludes that disinformation operates not merely as a crisis of information accuracy but as an epistemic threat to democratic deliberation. Addressing this challenge requires an integrated strategy that combines policy, technology, education, and civic renewal.",
          "A rapidly increasing amount of human conversation occurs online. But divisiveness and conflict can fester in text-based interactions on social media platforms, in messaging apps, and on other digital forums. Such toxicity increases polarization and, importantly, corrodes the capacity of diverse societies to develop efficient solutions to complex social problems that impact everyone. Scholars and civil society groups promote interventions that can make interpersonal conversations less divisive or more productive in offline settings, but scaling these efforts to the amount of discourse that occurs online is extremely challenging. We present results of a large-scale experiment that demonstrates how online conversations about divisive topics can be improved with artificial intelligence tools. Specifically, we employ a large language model to make real-time, evidence-based recommendations intended to improve participants' perception of feeling understood in conversations. We find that these interventions improve the reported quality of the conversation, reduce political divisiveness, and improve the tone, without systematically changing the content of the conversation or moving people's policy attitudes. These findings have important implications for future research on social media, political deliberation, and the growing community of scholars interested in the place of artificial intelligence within computational social science.",

          "One of the primary purposes of political communication research is to determine the position of the public on any political issue. It is now possible to gather and evaluate information about people's political lives from a sizable data pool around the globe. In the newly emerging field known as Computational Social Sciences, computer science is employed to acquire and analyze these data. Through the emergence of a trend on social media, Turkey has recently witnessed a race between supporters of the ruling party and opposition groupings. In this study, two pro-government and pro-opposition trends (On Twitter) were taken into account when conducting social network analyses. Data were obtained from Twitter. According to the research, the pro-government trend spread at a rate of 155 tweets per hour, while the opposition-supported trend expanded at a rate of 127 tweets per hour. The graphs' observations show that spreading the opposition trend involves the usage of fake accounts more frequently than spreading the government-supporting trend. However, it has been observed that fake accounts are effective in the opening and course of both trends. Accordingly, it is thought that fake accounts seriously contribute to trend formation on Twitter.",
          "In this study, we pair different perspectives on information sharing held by the information behaviour and computational social science communities. By reflecting on different conceptual models of sharing (two-actor vs three-actor model) and applying methods from social network analysis and text mining, we investigate the influence that different user interface features (retweeting and quote retweeting) have on politicians' sharing behaviour during an election campaign on the social media platform Twitter. Amongst other results, our analyses show that the two features are used quite differently with the quote RT feature promoting non-partisan interaction, which leads to a more civilized discourse with opponents and support for colleagues.",
          "This study details an approach for the analysis of social media collected political data through the lens of Topological Data Analysis, with a specific focus on Persistent Homology and the political processes they represent by proposing a set of mathematical generalizations using Gaussian functions to define and analyze these Persistent Homology categories. Three distinct types of Persistent Homologies were recurrent across datasets that had been plotted through retweeting patterns and analyzed through the k-Nearest-Neighbor filtrations. As these Persistent Homologies continued to appear, they were then categorized and dubbed Nuclear, Bipolar, and Multipolar Constellations. Upon investigating the content of these plotted tweets, specific patterns of interaction and political information dissemination were identified, namely Political Personalism and Political Polarization. Through clustering and application of Gaussian density functions, I have mathematically characterized each category, encapsulating their distinctive topological features. The mathematical generalizations of Bipolar, Nuclear, and Multipolar Constellations developed in this study are designed to inspire other political science digital media researchers to utilize these categories as to identify Persistent Homology in datasets derived from various social media platforms, suggesting the broader hypothesis that such structures are bound to be present on political scraped data regardless of the social media it's derived from. This method aims to offer a new perspective in Network Analysis as it allows for an exploration of the underlying shape of the networks formed by retweeting patterns, enhancing the understanding of digital interactions within the sphere of Computational Social Sciences.",
          "There is widespread concern that Russia and other countries have launched social-media campaigns designed to increase political divisions in the United States. Though a growing number of studies analyze the strategy of such campaigns, it is not yet known how these efforts shaped the political attitudes and behaviors of Americans. We study this question using longitudinal data that describe the attitudes and online behaviors of 1,239 Republican and Democratic Twitter users from late 2017 merged with nonpublic data about the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) from Twitter. Using Bayesian regression tree models, we find no evidence that interaction with IRA accounts substantially impacted 6 distinctive measures of political attitudes and behaviors over a 1-mo period. We also find that interaction with IRA accounts were most common among respondents with strong ideological homophily within their Twitter network, high interest in politics, and high frequency of Twitter usage. Together, these findings suggest that Russian trolls might have failed to sow discord because they mostly interacted with those who were already highly polarized. We conclude by discussing several important limitations of our study—especially our inability to determine whether IRA accounts influenced the 2016 presidential election—as well as its implications for future research on social media influence campaigns, political polarization, and computational social science.",

          "Abstract The intersection of social media and politics is yet another realm in which Computational Social Science has a paramount role to play. In this review, I examine the questions that computational social scientists are attempting to answer – as well as the tools and methods they are developing to do so – in three areas where the rise of social media has led to concerns about the quality of democracy in the digital information era: online hate; misinformation; and foreign influence campaigns. I begin, however, by considering a precursor of these topics – and also a potential hope for social media to be able to positively impact the quality of democracy – by exploring attempts to measure public opinion online using Computational Social Science methods. In all four areas, computational social scientists have made great strides in providing information to policy makers and the public regarding the evolution of these very complex phenomena but in all cases could do more to inform public policy with better access to the necessary data; this point is discussed in more detail in the conclusion of the review.",
          "With the advent of Twitter and the ability to collect large datasets from this technology, researchers have the opportunity to analyze political participation in cross-national electoral contexts. This paper capitalizes on this capability to examine political polarization and citizen engagement during the US and French presidential campaigns. We use the Twitter Gardenhose collection to filter tweets based on keywords around a 50-day window, from March 19, 2012 to May 8, 2012 for the French election and September 19, 2012 to November 8, 2012 for the US Election, particularly focusing on on engagement during the US and French presidential debates on October 3, 2012 and May 2, 2012, respectively. From these data, we constructed partisan alignments based on hashtag usage and retweet networks. We found evidence of more stark political polarization in the French case, while the US case demonstrated less partisan division. This study elaborates commonalities and contrasts in the use of a major social medium by citizens in contexts that differ in political culture and language but feature similar ideological divides, electoral politics, and campaign contexts. We conclude by discussing the implications of computational social science and \"big data\" in communications, comparative politics, and political sociology.",
          "The study of opinion dynamics is a core object of computational social science research. In this research note we report on an exploratory study on opinion dynamics on the far right of the political spectrum. We use the example of a political party in Germany that is under a cloud of being right-wing extremist, albeit not banned by law. We consider social-media data as a promising alternative to surveys when people have an interest in expressing their political views publicly. Then the social media may enable relatively undisguised insights into worldviews even if these views deviate more strongly from the mainstream. The chapter presents findings of this study and gives a summary of methodological merits of the underlying design of a combined analysis of content (textual data) and link structure (trace data).",
          "Previous research demonstrates that traditional campaign strategies such as door-to-door canvassing and advertisement have minimal persuasive effects on voters’ political attitudes and vote choice while simultaneously demonstrating strong activation effects on voters’ existing preferences. From this literature, numerous theoretical perspectives on campaign contact have emerged. The most predominant is the minimal effects thesis, which posits that campaigns have minimal effect influencing voters’ political attitudes, vote choice, and consequently, election outcomes. In contrast, the activation effects thesis posits that campaigns are consequential to election outcomes because campaign contact activates voters’ existing political preferences and mobilizes the electorate to vote. This thesis proposes to reconcile the two theoretical perspectives by demonstrating that the same type of campaign contact may have both minimal persuasive effects on voters’ political preferences and strong activation effects on voters’ emotions. The thesis hypothesizes then that campaign contact evokes emotional responses that encourage rather than discourage voting. To this end, the thesis examines campaign effects online from a unique dataset queried from Facebook consisting of federal party leaders’ campaign messages (N = 1,711) and the responses to those messages from everyday Facebook users (n = 92,813) during the 2015 Canadian general election campaign. Computational social science methods are employed to directly measure campaign contact’s persuasive and activation effects on partisan and nonpartisan Facebook users. The results demonstrate that campaign contact online has a minimal persuasive effect on Facebook users’ self-expressed political preferences as well as strong activation effects on those preferences. Activation effects manifest as emotional responses that are most pronounced when individuals react to attitude-divergent rather than attitude-consistent campaign messaging. Exposure to attitude-divergent contact evokes Facebook users to experience discrete negative emotions such as anger, which previous research has shown to increase the electorate’s propensity to vote. The efficacy of negative emotions, however, may incentivize political parties to adopt strategies that demonize political opponents and which may, therefore, contribute to negative partisanship online.",
          "The digital age, particularly the transformative period between 2020 and 2025, has seen social media morph from a communication channel to a strong architect of consumer reality, dramatically affecting views and loyalty dynamics. This study addresses the central paradox of this evolution: social media serves as a powerful dual force, cultivating deep brand allegiance through immersive community engagement and user-generated content (UGC) while eroding trust through algorithmic bias, misinformation proliferation, and the opaque pathways of \"dark social.\" The study explains how algorithmically curated feeds actively shape consumer perception using an integrated methodology that combines a systematic review of interdisciplinary literature (marketing science, computational social science, and behavioral psychology) with rigorous empirical case studies. Key findings show that algorithmic personalization creates individualized \"selective exposure economies,\" reinforcing existing beliefs and speeding up attitudinal entrenchment, while UGC credibility serves as a key, albeit fragile, bridge to behavioral loyalty. The analysis identifies acute tensions: micro-influencers foster authentic community bonds, whereas macro-influencers jeopardize credibility through over-commercialization; hyper-personalization drives convenience and loyalty for some segments, but causes backlash and participation in cancel culture for others who perceive inauthenticity or ethical lapses. This relationship polarization, in which platforms enhance both strong loyalty and virulent hatred, highlights the fundamental volatility of algorithmically controlled brand interactions. Finally, the study offers concrete frameworks for navigating this landscape, stressing neuro-agile sensing, ethical personalization boundaries, and ways for creating resilient trust in polarized digital ecosystems",

Echo chambers and filter bubbles are evocative metaphors, but Americans actually are exposed to a wide spectrum of political opinion. Politically driven disinformation is not widespread nor widely believed. From his own work, he deftly presents an ambitious field experiment with surprising results that...",
          "This concluding essay begins with a discussion of how the evolution of communication technologies has shaped perceptions of professionalism in political campaigning in India and elsewhere. Highlights from the empirical case studies in this volume are discussed, setting the thematic case studies on political campaigning in the comparative cross-national context of research on political marketing within the field of political communication. Research on media agenda-setting, priming and framing processes and effects are discussed with respect to future research opportunities, as well as methods for conducting campaigning and political communication research in India. Apart from rich ethnographic studies that have been more common in India, methods to study information, campaign engagement and effects include content analysis, ‘big data’ and text analysis, survey research, panel studies and experiments. India’s political parties and candidates, publics, and diverse media provide an abundance of online data that may be best analysed using computational social science methods.",
          "Recent surveys indicate most Americans are reluctant to share their political views on social media. This study examines how social identity and group composition shape self-censorship in a simulated social media setting. I recruited Democrats and Republicans (N=758) to complete a survey about their political views and randomized them into to chats to discuss a politically contentious issue with members of the other party or members from their own party. I find Democrats are more likely to disclose their opinions to Republicans than to fellow Democrats. Yet Republicans were no more likely to express their opinions to Democrats or Republicans. This research underscores the significance of political identity dynamics on the expression of minority views and uses a behavioral measure of self-censorship which may improve upon previous self-reported measures of self-censorship. My study thus contributes to ongoing debates with political sociology, social psychology, and the emerging field of computational social science.",
          "Measuring culture and its dynamics through surveys has important limitations, but the emerging field of computational social science allows us to overcome them by analyzing large-scale datasets. In this paper, we study cultural dynamics through the votes in the Eurovision song contest, which are decided by a crowd-based scheme in which viewers vote through mobile phone messages. Taking into account asymmetries and imperfect perception of culture, we measure cultural relations among European countries in terms of cultural affinity. We propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient, a metric to measure voting biases among participants of a Eurovision contest. We validate how this metric represents cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances, and through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests. We apply this metric to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, finding new patterns of stronger modularity than using votes alone. Furthermore, we define a measure of polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp increase within EU countries during 2010 and 2011. We empirically validate the relation between this polarization and economic indicators in the EU, showing how political decisions influence both the economy and the way citizens relate to the culture of other EU members.",
          "It is our pleasure to welcome you to the first edition of the Politics, Elections and Data workshop (PLEAD at CIKM 2012). The goal of this workshop, taking place a few days before the 2012 U.S. presidential elections, is to bring together researchers working at the intersection of social network analysis, computational social science and political science, to share and discuss their ideas in a common forum; and to inspire further developments in this growing, fascinating field of computational political science. The call for papers attracted submissions from researchers in different areas and from different countries, which underscores the wide appeal of computational political science. The program committee accepted 6 papers which cover a variety of topics: measuring the online popularity of political campaigns, the adoption of social networking platforms by members of the political class and the feasibility of characterizing political communities by tracking topics in the message streams of their members, analyzing patterns in candidate funding to discern the state of a political party, mining opinions on politically controversial topics and finally, analyzing the effects of voter microtargeting and proposing solutions for mitigating the more worrisome aspects. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech from Filippo Menczer on \"The Diffusion of Political Memes in Social Media\". Filippo presents ongoing work on the study of information diffusion in social media with a focus on polarization, cross-ideological communication and partisan asymmetries in online political activities. The workshop will also feature a presentation of existing online tools for political analysis and a panel discussion with industry, academia and media participants.",
          "There is mounting concern about the prevalence of toxic political content on social media. Policy makers and tech leaders have called for platforms to provide users with the choice to avoid such content via algorithmic intervention, but little is known about how such reforms would be received by social media users. We present two survey experiments on a simulated social media platform to examine how choice shapes user's attitudes about content as well as the platforms themselves. We find that most users elect to avoid such content--- and that being offered this choice improves evaluations of the platform. However, offering this choice either has no effects on their attitudes about platform content, or makes them rate the content they view more negatively. Our findings have important implications for future research on political polarization, social psychology, and the growing field of computational social science.",
          "ABSTRACT Nonprofit organizations embrace social media due to its cost‐effectiveness and timely communication capabilities. However, the direct financial returns of social media engagement remain uncertain in the current literature. How does engagement on social media impact the performance of fundraising campaigns for small nonprofit organizations? This study examines a sample of 100 small nonprofit organizations that disclosed their 2020 Giving Tuesday campaign performance on Twitter. Using a computational social science method, the study analyzes their Twitter account activities. The investigation explores the impact of account activeness and engagement on fundraising campaign outcomes across five periods: within the #GivingTuesday hashtag, 1 week before the campaign, 1 month before, 1 year before, and since account establishment. The results reveal mixed effects of social media engagement on fundraising performance, contributing to the nonprofit literature on communication effectiveness, signaling, reputation building, and public engagement. The findings also offer practical implications for nonprofit practitioners in effectively managing social media strategies.",

          "ABSTRACTGuided by the framework of contentious publicness, this study examines the role of mass media organizations in facilitating digital activism during the 2019–2020 Hong Kong anti-extradition movement. We collected movement tweets targeting media organizations, conceptualized as public-media messages, to identify what media outlets and what narratives were likely to generate more engagement. Findings revealed that activists tended to mobilize media based on colonial history and legitimacy. Furthermore, topic areas, media type, and technological affordances were all related to message publicness measured by the number of retweets and likes. Implications are provided regarding the process of mobilizing for contentious publicness.

          "Democracy faces a fundamental challenge in the digital age: how can computational tools enhance collective decision-making whilst preserving the meaningful human participation that gives democracy its legitimacy? This question becomes particularly urgent in pluralistic societies where diverse groups hold competing interests and values, requiring democratic systems that amplify rather than silence different voices. This thesis examines this challenge through three complementary empirical studies employing computational social science methodologies that span laboratory experiments, artificial intelligence simulations, and real-world field implementations across diverse democratic contexts. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive literature review situating this research within contemporary debates about computational social choice, algorithmic fairness, and digital democracy. It examines how democracy functions as both an information-processing system and a form of collective intelligence, whilst exploring how digital technologies both enhance and threaten pluralistic participation. Chapter 3 presents controlled laboratory experiments with 180 participants examining citizens' preferences for digital voting systems in participatory budgeting contexts. The research reveals that citizens strongly prefer expressive voting methods—such as ranking systems and point distribution—over simpler alternatives, valuing their ability to communicate nuanced preferences. Participants consistently rated the Method of Equal Shares algorithm as significantly fairer than conventional approaches, appreciating how it ensures proportional representation for diverse community interests rather than allowing majorities to dominate outcomes. Chapter 4 employs computational simulations comparing voting behaviours between large language models (GPT-4 and LLaMA-2) and human participants. AI systems exhibited markedly different patterns, showing reduced preference diversity, problematic sensitivity to presentation order, and concerning biases toward specific project types. These findings suggest current AI should support rather than replace human decision-making in pluralistic contexts. Chapter 5 presents real-world field implementations demonstrating how computational methods can successfully bridge voting and deliberation. Three novel approaches—Preference-based Clustering for structuring discussion groups, Human-in-the-Loop Method of Equal Shares for balancing algorithmic and deliberative decision-making, and ReadTheRoom methods for visualising opinion evolution—show how technology can connect individual preferences with collective wisdom whilst respecting diverse viewpoints. The findings challenge conventional assumptions about both democratic participation and human-AI collaboration. Rather than seeking the simplest possible interfaces, citizens value systems that enable rich expression of their preferences. Rather than viewing algorithms and human judgement as competing forces, thoughtful design can harness both computational efficiency and human wisdom to address traditional limitations of scale and representation in participatory processes. This research demonstrates how pluralistic democracies can adapt to technological change whilst maintaining their core values. By combining computational social choice theory with human-centred design principles, the work offers practical guidance for creating more inclusive democratic systems. The findings establish new frameworks for algorithmic fairness in collective decision-making, methods for bridging individual preferences with group deliberation, and approaches for designing digital tools that genuinely serve diverse communities. The research ultimately reveals promising possibilities for democratic innovations that enhance both participation and representation, creating new opportunities for more responsive governance in an increasingly complex world.",
          "There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating \"echo chambers\" that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. One week later, we randomly assigned respondents to a treatment condition in which they were offered financial incentives to follow a Twitter bot for one month that exposed them to messages produced by elected officials, organizations, and other opinion leaders with opposing political ideologies. Respondents were re-surveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment, and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative post-treatment, and Democrats who followed a conservative Twitter bot became slightly more liberal post-treatment. These findings have important implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization as well as the emerging field of computational social science.",

          "Sander van der Linden is Professor of Social Psychology in Society in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab. Before coming to Cambridge, he held posts at Princeton and Yale University. His research interests center around the psychology of human judgment and decision-making. In particular, he is interested in the social influence and persuasion process and how people are influenced by (mis)information and gain resistance to persuasion through psychological inoculation. He is also interested in the study of fake news, media effects, social networks, and belief systems (e.g., conspiracy theories), as well as the emergence of social norms, polarization, reasoning about evidence, and public understanding of risk and uncertainty. His research spans from social psychology to cognitive science using a variety of techniques, from virtual reality to survey and lab studies to computational social science and large-scale (online) interventions. His forthcoming book FOOLPROOF: Why Misinformation Infects Our Brains, and How to Build Immunity (WW Norton/HarperCollins) is to be published later this month. He has published around 150 papers and is ranked among the top 1% of all social scientists worldwide (Clarivate ISI Highly Cited Researcher) and among the top 2% across all scientific fields (Ioannidis, Boyack, &amp; Baas, 2020). Abstract Much like a viral contagion, misinformation can spread rapidly from one mind to another. Moreover, once lodged in memory, misinformation is difficult to correct. Inoculation theory therefore offers a natural basis for developing a psychological ‘vaccine’ against the spread of fake news and misinformation. Specifically, in a series of randomized lab and field studies, I’ll show that it is possible to pre-emptively ‘immunize’ people against disinformation about a wide range of topics by pre-exposing them to severely weakened doses of the techniques that underlie its production. This process of ‘prebunking’ helps people cultivate cognitive antibodies in a simulated social media environment. During the talk, I’ll showcase several real-world interventions we developed and empirically evaluated in 20 languages—with governments and social media companies—to help citizens around the world recognize and resist unwanted attempts to influence and mislead.",
          "The past decade in the US has been one of the most politically polarizing in recent memory. Increasingly, ordinary Democrats and Republicans fundamentally dislike and distrust each other, even when they agree on policy issues. Most Americans report believing that the opposing party is a \"serious threat to the United States and its people\". This extreme partisan hostility has wide-ranging consequences, even affecting how partisans respond to COVID-19 mitigation measures. In this context, this dissertation aims to reduce hostile interactions and attitudes towards ordinary Democrats and Republicans. I argue that we can reduce hostility by leveraging nonpolitical online spaces that cut through the partisan faultlines in uniquely engaging ways. I develop approaches to transform the currently hostile, uninspiring nature of online political interactions into not only a safe experience but also a fun and informative one. I take a mixed-methods approach to studying outpartisan hostility, combining computational social science with design methods. The dissertation progresses from a large-scale exploratory analysis of online political discussions to developing potential designs to reduce online partisan hostility and, finally, to designing and evaluating a fun party game that reduces outparty hostility. In the first study, through large-scale computational analysis of billions of Reddit comments, I find that nearly half of all political discussions on Reddit take place in nonpolitical communities and that cross-partisan political conversations in these communities are less toxic than those in explicitly political communities. These findings suggest that shared nonpolitical interests can temper online partisan hostility. In the second study, through in-depth qualitative interviews and design probes, I explore approaches to surface these nonpolitical interests and identities during online political interactions on Reddit. I demonstrate that participants are comfortable knowing and revealing shared memberships in nonpolitical communities with outpartisan discussion partners which they expect to be humanizing, potentially reducing the hostility in those interactions. Through the interviews, I find that apart from serious deliberative discussions, participants also engage in light-hearted and casual political interactions where the motivation to simply entertain themselves and have fun. In the final study, drawing on insights from the prior study and extant political science research, I develop an online party game that combines the relaxed, playful nonpartisan norms of casual games with corrective information about Democrats' and Republicans' political views that are often misperceived. Through an experiment, I find that playing the game significantly reduces hostile attitudes toward outparty supporters among Democrats. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates the potential of using nonpolitical context to facilitate quality online cross-partisan interactions that account for and mitigate the heightened levels of partisan animosity we observe today.",
          "Abstract We present a study in the context of computational social science that explores the topics debated in the context of the 2021 German Federal Election by using the topic modeling technique BERTopic. The corpus consists of German language tweets posted by political party accounts of the major German parties, as well as tweets by the general public mentioning the party accounts. We examined the textual content of the tweets but also included the text in images that were posted into the analysis by extracting the text using optical character recognition (OCR). Our results show that the most frequently discussed topics are party-oriented policies (including call-to-action content), climate policy and financial policy, with these topics being discussed in tweets by both, the political party accounts and tweets by accounts mentioning them. In addition, we observed that some topics were discussed consistently throughout the year, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate policy or digitization, while other topics, such as the return to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan or Israel were debated to a greater extent at limited time frames during the election year.",
          "Social media empowers citizens to raise the voice and expressed civil outrage leads to collective action to change the society. Since social media welcomes anyone regardless of the political ideology or perspectives, social media is where the supporters and opponents of specific issue discuss. This study attempts to empirically examine a recent anti-racism movement initiated by the death of George Floyd with the lens of stance prediction and aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). First, this study found the stance of the tweet and users do change over the course of the protest. Furthermore, there are more users who shifted the stance compared to those who maintained the stance. Second, both supporters and opponents expressed negative sentiment more on nine extracted aspects. This indicates that there was no significant difference of sentiment among supporters and opponents and raise a caution in predicting stance based on the sentiment. The contribution of the study is two-fold. First, ABSA was explored in the context of computational social science and second, stance prediction was first attempted at scale.",
          "What is the role of the internet in politics general and during campaigns in particular? And what is the role of large amounts of user data in all of this? In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign the Democrats were far more successful than the Republicans in utilizing online media for mobilization, co-ordination and fundraising. For the first time, social media and the Internet played a fundamental role in political campaigns. However, technical research in this area has been surprisingly limited and fragmented. The goal of this workshop is to bring together, for the first time, researchers working at the intersection of social network analysis, computational social science and political science, to share and discuss their ideas in a common forum; and to inspire further developments in this growing, fascinating field. The workshop has Filippo Menczer as keynote speaker, it includes technical presentations of accepted papers and concludes with a panel discussion where scientists and media experts from different fields can interact and share views.",
          "Reddit, one of the largest global social media platforms, has undergone significant transformations since its inception in 2005. From a loosely structured, niche platform to a globally recognized company with a standardized and regulated governance system, Reddit’s evolution has been marked by a shift in the power dynamics between its owners, moderators, and users. 2015 and 2023 were marked by the occurrence of two prominent protests, termed “blackouts.” Moderators of numerous subreddits, though not all, disabled public access to their subreddits, thereby protesting the company’s policies and policy changes and challenging the company’s endeavors to exert further control over the platform. Drawing on Bourdieusian theory and relational methodology, we establish a computational social science approach to investigate the structural causes behind the two blackouts and contextualize the differences between them. We argue that these blackouts signify growing tensions within the socio-technical space of Reddit and an ongoing political, cultural, and economic reconfiguration of its power structure and political economy.",
          "Do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social problems by engaging in rational debate, or by appealing to emotions? We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These “cognitive-emotional currents” create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation, how social contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational social science.",
          "Communication is central to a functional, representative democracy. In an ideal world, processes such as group deliberation, media consumption, and political persuasion allow members of the public to form coalitions based on common interests and participate in elections with healthy, informed beliefs. This dissertation presents three novel media datasets to further our understanding of three important forms of political communication that enable these processes in the present era: (i) election news coverage on television, (ii) public relations from corporations, and (iii) public meetings in local government. In the first paper (co-authored with David Rothschild), I describe how local television news covers candidates for federal office using broadcast transcripts from nearly 2,000 races across 3 electoral cycles. Moreover, I causally demonstrate that television news coverage (earned media) can, in many cases, deliver greater electoral gains than television advertisements (paid media) that are conventionally studied in campaign media effects. In the second paper, I systematically describe how the most recognized consumer brands in America use political cues in public speech and measure whether and how these cues represent their stakeholders' preferences as well as their parent firms' ideological priorities. In the third paper (co-authored with Tyler Simko), I argue that public meetings are the central political institution of local government and introduce LocalView, a new dataset of over 100,000 real-time public meeting transcripts from more than 2,000 local governments in the U.S, as a means of studying this institution at scale. In two applications, I harness this database to demonstrate map how local policy agendas - for example, COVID-19 public health responses - vary across partisan geographies. Together, this body of work leverages modern computational social science tools to advance our knowledge of political communication with implications for theories of elections, local government, political economy, and partisan polarization.",

          "A fundamental tenet of democracy is that political parties present policy alternatives, such that the public can participate in the decision-making process. Parties, however, strategically control public discussion by emphasising topics that they believe will highlight their strengths in voters’ minds. Political strategy has been studied for decades, mostly by manually annotating and analysing party statements, press coverage, or TV ads. Here we build on recent work in the areas of computational social science and eDemocracy, which studied these concepts computationally with social media. We operationalize issue engagement and related political science theories to measure and quantify politicians’ communication behavior using more than 366k Tweets posted by over 1,000 prominent German politicians in the 2017 election year. To this end, we first identify issues in posted Tweets by utilising a hashtag-based approach well known in the literature. This method allows several prominent issues featuring in the political debate on Twitter that year to be identified. We show that different political parties engage to a larger or lesser extent with these issues. The findings reveal differing social media strategies by parties located at different sides of the political left-right scale, in terms of which issues they engage with, how confrontational they are and how their strategies evolve in the lead-up to the election. Whereas previous work has analysed the general public’s use of Twitter or politicians’ communication in terms of cross-party polarisation, this is the first study of political science theories, relating to issue engagement, using politicians’ social media data.",
          "Computational social science has been emerging over the last several years as a hotbed of interesting work, taking advantage of, to quote Lazer et al. (Science, v.323), \"digital traces that can be compiled into comprehensive pictures of both individual and group behavior, with the potential to transform our understanding of our lives, organizations, and societies.\"Within that larger setting, I'm interested in how language is used to influence people, with an emphasis on computational modeling of agendas (who is most effectively directing attention, and toward what topics?), framing or \"spin\" (what underlying perspective does this language seek to encourage?), and sentiment (how does someone feel, as evidenced in the language they use)?These questions are particularly salient in political discourse.In this talk, I'll present recent work looking at political debates and other conversations using Bayesian models to capture relevant aspects of the conversational dynamics, as well as new methods for collecting people's reactions to speeches, debates, and other public conversations on a large scale.",
          "Abstract This article explores the newspaper discourse surrounding a paradigm shift in social policy. The case at hand, Germany, is a prime example of a welfare state that was particularly resistant to reform. Hence, the rapid paradigm shift in German family policy since the late 1990s is puzzling. This study seeks to resolve this puzzle by drawing on the insight that public discourse is crucial for policy change. Politicians have to promote reforms prior to their implementation. The main channel for communication with the wider public is the mass media. I use newspaper coverage from 1990 to 2016 to analyze whether the media is responsive to reform initiatives. I use topic modeling, an innovative method from the computational social sciences (CSS), to identify dominant themes and shifts over time in a large corpus of newspaper articles ( N = 1,459). The analysis shows that public discourse was responsive to the parliamentary debate. The article also clarifies the role of critical events and identifies discursive strategies.",
          "We present our approach to online popularity and its applications to political science, aiming at the creation of agent-based models that reproduce patterns of popularity in participatory media. We illustrate our approach analyzing a dataset from Youtube, composed of the view statistics and comments for the videos of the U.S. presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012. Using sentiment analysis, we quantify the collective emotions expressed by the viewers, finding that democrat campaigns elicited more positive collective emotions than republican campaigns. Techniques from computational social science allow us to measure virality of the videos of each campaign, to find that democrat videos are shared faster but republican ones are remembered longer inside the community. Last we present our work in progress in voting advice applications, and our results analyzing the data from choose4greece.com. We show how we assess the policy differences between parties and their voters, and how voting advice applications can be extended to test our agent-based models.",
          "By the end of September 2022, a plebiscite about a new pension law suggested once more that the western Swiss region of the Arc Lémanique (AL) is politically different from the rest of Switzerland. Newspapers argued that this is the result of the proximity to France with the same language as the AL. This paper tries to find out, how far the political opinions of the AL are away from the rest of Switzerland and how close they are to France. For this purpose, the author presents a new methodology from computational social science: virtual encounter simulations, which he successfully applied in an earlier publication to similar problems. It is based on the idea of using survey data for the construction of random-dyads of persons, who can subsequently be compared with regard to their political attitudes. By averaging the inter-individual differences of dyads of persons belonging to the same group and dyads belonging to different groups it is possible to compare ideological inter-group with intra-group conflicts. In order to tackle the initial research question, the author analyses the international survey ISSP-V (2016), focussed on the role of government, also with regard to the mentioned old age pensions. Virtual encounter simulations reveal that the AL is ideologically much closer to German speaking Switzerland than originally expected.",
          "The integrity of democratic political discourse is at the core to guarantee free and fair elections. With social media often dictating the tones and trends of politics-related discussion, it is of paramount important to be able to study online chatter, especially in the run up to important voting events, like in the case of the upcoming November 3, 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Limited access to social media data is often the first barrier to impede, hinder, or slow down progress, and ultimately our understanding of online political discourse. To mitigate this issue and try to empower the Computational Social Science research community, we decided to publicly release a massive-scale, longitudinal dataset of U.S. politics- and election-related tweets. This multilingual dataset that we have been collecting for over one year encompasses hundreds of millions of tweets and tracks all salient U.S. politics trends, actors, and events between 2019 and 2020. It predates and spans the whole period of Republican and Democratic primaries, with real-time tracking of all presidential contenders of both sides of the isle. After that, it focuses on presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Our dataset release is curated, documented and will be constantly updated on a weekly-basis, until the November 3, 2020 election and beyond. We hope that the academic community, computational journalists, and research practitioners alike will all take advantage of our dataset to study relevant scientific and social issues, including problems like misinformation, information manipulation, interference, and distortion of online political discourse that have been prevalent in the context of recent election events in the United States and worldwide.

          "The future of any environmental policy all depends on the view of the citizens since the support of its citizens directly acquires the outcome of such a policy; whether to be successful, or not in terms of compliance, political will and long term sustainability. The social media expansion has been more visible and disorganized, polarized and fragmented because of public opinion. The proposed research is based on the concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to conduct a bulk of sentiment analysis of social media information regarding the environmental-related policy debate of carbon taxes, plastic bans and the incorporation of renewable energy. It was chosen to follow the hybrid research methodology approach that would involve both the sentiment classification via lexicon and the machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and deep learning-based Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT). The social media variables were collected on Twitter (X) and Facebook in 2022-2024, and covered over 1.2 million posts, comments, and hashtags on policy debates. The results indicate that the correlation between the popular view and the policy acceptance is high with the policies on renewable energy having predominantly positive sentiment ( +62) and the carbon tax proposals having negative sentiment ( -54) referring to the affordability aspect. The temporal trend analysis indicated that there were occurrences of negative sentiment when announcements of political nature and environmental protests were high. The findings indicate the usefulness of NLP-informed sentiment analysis in providing a policy holder with actionable information, policy-based communication, improved stakeholder engagement, and responsive policymaking within the environmental context. The article demonstrates that computational social science can be used alongside existing methods of policy evaluation to offer scalable and real-time monitoring of the social opinion regarding environmental governance.",
          "For economics and sociological research, lists of industries and their branches are widely used in research to categorize data and get an overview on different types of industries. However, many different taxonomies and ordering schema exist, due to different research focus but also due to different national scenarios and interests. In this paper, we will focus without loss of generality on regional data from Germany. Manual annotation of textual data is time-consuming and tedious, naturally giving rise to our initial research question, also highly inspired by questions from computational social sciences: How can we automatically categorize textual data, e.g. job advertisements or business Profiles, by industrial sectors We will present an approach towards classification using a pre-trained domain-adapted Transformer model. We find that domain-adapted models generalize better and outperform state of the art non domain-adapted Transformer models on Out-Of-Distribution data. Additionally, we open source two novel data-sets mapping textual data to WZ2008 sections and divisions, enabling further research.",
          "Narratives play a vital role in shaping public perceptions and policy on emerging technologies like quantum technology (QT). However, little is known about the construction and variation of QT narratives across societal domains. This study examines how QT is presented in business, media, and government texts using thematic narrative analysis. Our research design utilizes an extensive dataset of 36 government documents, 165 business reports, and 2,331 media articles published over 20 years. We employ a computational social science approach, combining BERTopic modeling with qualitative assessment to extract themes and narratives. The findings show that public discourse on QT reflects prevailing social and political agendas, focusing on technical and commercial potential, global conflicts, national strategies, and social issues. Media articles provide the most balanced coverage, while business and government discourses often overlook societal implications. We discuss the ramifications for integrating QT into society and the need for wellinformed public discourse.",
          "We present a simple approach to the generation and labeling of extraction patterns for coding political event data, an important task in computational social science. We use weak supervision to identify pattern candidates and learn distributed representations for them. Given seed extraction patterns from existing pattern dictionaries, we use label propagation to label pattern candidates. We present two case studies. i) We derive patterns of acceptable quality for a number of international relations & conflicts categories using pattern candidates of O’Connor et al (2013). ii) We derive patterns for coding protest events that outperform an established set of Tabari / Petrarch hand-crafted patterns.",
          "To explain social phenomena and identify systematic biases, much research in computational social science focuses on comparative text analyses. These studies often rely on coarse corpus-level statistics or local word-level analyses, mainly in English. We introduce the InfoGap method -- an efficient and reliable approach to locating information gaps and inconsistencies in articles at the fact level, across languages. We evaluate InfoGap by analyzing LGBT people's portrayals, across 2.7K biography pages on English, Russian, and French Wikipedias. We find large discrepancies in factual coverage across the languages. Moreover, our analysis reveals that biographical facts carrying negative connotations are more likely to be highlighted in Russian Wikipedia. Crucially, InfoGap both facilitates large scale analyses, and pinpoints local document- and fact-level information gaps, laying a new foundation for targeted and nuanced comparative language analysis at scale.",
          "Understanding who blames or supports whom in news text is a critical research question in computational social science. Traditional methods and datasets for sentiment analysis are, however, not suitable for the domain of political text as they do not consider the direction of sentiments expressed between entities. In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task of identifying directed sentiment relationship between political entities from a given news document, which we call directed sentiment extraction. From a million-scale news corpus, we construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. The newly proposed problem, data, and method will facilitate future studies on interdisciplinary NLP methods and applications.",
          "Word embeddings improve the performance of NLP systems by revealing the hidden structural relationships between words. Despite their success in many applications, word embeddings have seen very little use in computational social science NLP tasks, presumably due to their reliance on big data, and to a lack of interpretability. I propose a probabilistic model-based word embedding method which can recover interpretable embeddings, without big data. The key insight is to leverage mixed membership modeling, in which global representations are shared, but individual entities (i.e. dictionary words) are free to use these representations to uniquely differing degrees. I show how to train the model using a combination of state-of-the-art training techniques for word embeddings and topic models. The experimental results show an improvement in predictive language modeling of up to 63% in MRR over the skip-gram, and demonstrate that the representations are beneficial for supervised learning. I illustrate the interpretability of the models with computational social science case studies on State of the Union addresses and NIPS articles.",
          "Online polarization poses a growing challenge for democratic discourse, yet most computational social science research remains monolingual, culturally narrow, or event-specific. We introduce POLAR, a multilingual, multicultural, and multi-event dataset with over 110K instances in 22 languages drawn from diverse online platforms and real-world events. Polarization is annotated along three axes, namely detection, type, and manifestation, using a variety of annotation platforms adapted to each cultural context. We conduct two main experiments: (1) fine-tuning six pretrained small language models; and (2) evaluating a range of open and closed large language models in few-shot and zero-shot settings. The results show that, while most models perform well in binary polarization detection, they achieve substantially lower performance when predicting polarization types and manifestations. These findings highlight the complex, highly contextual nature of polarization and demonstrate the need for robust, adaptable approaches in NLP and computational social science. All resources will be released to support further research and effective mitigation of digital polarization globally.",
          "Information from news articles can be used to study correlations between textual discourse and socioeconomic patterns. This work focuses on the task of understanding how words contained in the news as well as the news outlets themselves may relate to a set of indicators, such as economic sentiment or unemployment rates. The bilinear nature of the applied regression model facilitates learning jointly word and outlet importance, supervised by these indicators. By evaluating the predictive ability of the extracted features, we can also assess their relevance to the target socioeconomic phenomena. Therefore, our approach can be formulated as a potential NLP tool, particularly suitable to the computational social science community, as it can be used to interpret connections between vast amounts of textual content and measurable societydriven factors.",
          "Legislative debates are understudied in political science. Modern tools for analyzing speech content has, fortunately, given us an opportunity to make inferences based on an ever increasing accessibility of vast corpora of texts that has only been analyzed in parts before. This thesis covers Norwegian parliamentary debates with the overarching theme of using speech to assess the effects of institutional and external shocks on MP behavior. The thesis has three main contributions. First, it provides a large corpus of automatically annotated Norwegian parliamentary debates – both the first openly accessible structured data on parliamentary debates in Norway and the first open access linguistically annotated parliamentary speech data in the world. Second, the thesis shows how contextual knowledge and data pre-processing is invaluable for subsequent analyses. Finally, the thesis gives two examples of inferential analyses on MP behavior based on parliamentary debates: these analyses show that changing electoral systems alters the vote-seeking incentives of MPs and that disproportional external shocks alter the behavior of MPs based on their constituency, rather than party affiliation.",

          "This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends—beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families—word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches—and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.",
          "News data have become essential resources across various disciplines. Still, access to full-text news corpora remains challenging due to high costs and the limited availability of free alternatives. This paper presents a novel Python package (gdeltnews) that reconstructs full-text newspaper articles at near-zero cost by leveraging the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Web News NGrams 3.0 dataset. Our method merges overlapping n-grams extracted from global online news to rebuild complete articles. We validate the approach on a benchmark set of 2211 articles from major U.S. news outlets, achieving up to 95% text similarity against original articles based on Levenshtein and SequenceMatcher metrics. Our tool facilitates economic forecasting, computational social science, information science, and natural language processing applications by enabling free and large-scale access to full-text news data.",
          "Many computational social science projects examine online discourse surrounding a specific trending topic.These works often involve the acquisition of large-scale corpora relevant to the event in question to analyze aspects of the response to the event.Keyword searches present a precision-recall trade-off and crowd-sourced annotations, while effective, are costly.This work aims to enable automatic and accurate ad-hoc retrieval of comments discussing a trending topic from a large corpus, using only a handful of seed news articles.",
          "Detecting named entities in text has long been a core NLP task. However, not much work has gone into distinguishing whether an entity mention is addressing the entity vs. referring to the entity; e.g., John, would you turn the light off? vs. John turned the light off. While this distinction is marked by a vocative case marker in some languages, many modern Indo-European languages such as English do not use such explicit vocative markers, and the distinction is left to be interpreted in context. In this paper, we present a new annotated dataset that captures the address vs. reference distinction in English, an automatic tagger that performs at 85% accuracy in making this distinction, and demonstrate how this distinction is important in NLP and computational social science applications in English language.",
          "Language encodes societal beliefs about social groups through word patterns. While computational methods like word embeddings enable quantitative analysis of these patterns, studies have primarily examined gradual shifts in Western contexts. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of Chinese state-controlled media (1950-2019) to examine how revolutionary social transformations are reflected in official linguistic representations of social groups. Using diachronic word embeddings at multiple temporal resolutions, we find that Chinese representations differ significantly from Western counterparts, particularly regarding economic status, ethnicity, and gender. These representations show distinct evolutionary dynamics: while stereotypes of ethnicity, age, and body type remain remarkably stable across political upheavals, representations of gender and economic classes undergo dramatic shifts tracking historical transformations. This work advances our understanding of how officially sanctioned discourse encodes social structure through language while highlighting the importance of non-Western perspectives in computational social science.",
          "We propose Quootstrap, a method for extracting quotations, as well as the names of the speakers who uttered them, from large news corpora. Whereas prior work has addressed this problem primarily with supervised machine learning, our approach follows a fully unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm. It leverages the redundancy present in large news corpora, more precisely, the fact that the same quotation often appears across multiple news articles in slightly different contexts. Starting from a few seed patterns, such as [\"Q\", said S.], our method extracts a set of quotation-speaker pairs (Q, S), which are in turn used for discovering new patterns expressing the same quotations; the process is then repeated with the larger pattern set. Our algorithm is highly scalable, which we demonstrate by running it on the large ICWSM 2011 Spinn3r corpus. Validating our results against a crowdsourced ground truth, we obtain 90% precision at 40% recall using a single seed pattern, with significantly higher recall values for more frequently reported (and thus likely more interesting) quotations. Finally, we showcase the usefulness of our algorithm's output for computational social science by analyzing the sentiment expressed in our extracted quotations.",
          "As multiple crises threaten the sustainability of our societies and pose at risk the planetary boundaries, complex challenges require timely, updated, and usable information. Natural-language processing (NLP) tools enhance and expand data collection and processing and knowledge utilization capabilities to support the definition of an inclusive, sustainable future. In this work, we apply different NLP techniques, tools and approaches to climate and sustainability documents to derive policy-relevant and actionable measures. We focus on general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) using a combination of static and prompt-based methods. We find that the use of LLMs is successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data. However, we also encounter challenges related to human intervention across different workflow stages and knowledge utilization for policy processes. Our work presents a critical but empirically grounded application of LLMs to complex policy problems and suggests avenues to further expand Artificial Intelligence-powered computational social sciences.",
          "In this paper, we introduce an annotated dataset of 11,704 unique U.S. news headlines related to critical race theory and its controversies from August 2020 through December 2022. Annotations generated by GPT-4 specify the headline stance and the primary actor in the headline. GPT-4 annotations performed well on the validation dataset, with weighted average F-scores of 0.8339 for headline stance annotations and 0.7625 for primary actor annotations. Along with the annotated headlines and URLs to the full article, we augment the dataset with metrics that are relevant to future research on political polarization, news frame analysis, and regional news coverage. The dataset includes partisan audience bias scores by news source domain, tags for mentions of U.S. states in the article body, and exposure and engagement metrics for articles shared on Reddit. Among other preliminary descriptive analyses, we find that the most prevalent headline stance in our headlines dataset is anti-CRT (43.06%), and the most prevalent primary actor in our headlines dataset is political influencers (56.56%). This paper describes the data collection methodology, preliminary descriptive analysis, and possible uses of the dataset for future research in political science, computational social sciences, and natural language processing.

          "This paper presents a new corpus for the Italian language representative of the fanfiction genre. It comprises about 55k user-generated stories inspired to the original fantasy saga \"Harry Potter\" and published on a popular website. The corpus is large enough to support data-driven investigations in many directions, from more traditional studies on language variation aimed at characterizing this genre with respect to more traditional ones, to emerging topics in computational social science such as the identification of factors involved in the success of a story. The latter is the focus of the presented case-study, in which a wide set of multi-level linguistic features has been automatically extracted from a subset of the corpus and analysed in order to detect the ones which significantly discriminate successful from unsuccessful stories",
          "This dataset supports computational modelling research on national-level political narratives, employing the Computable Structure of National Narrative (CSNN) as its theoretical framework. It systematically demonstrates how national narratives generate governance legitimacy and social cohesion through structured content configuration, affective mediation mechanisms, and semantic network coupling. The dataset is constructed from publicly available national-level political texts, processed through computational content analysis, sentiment analysis, and semantic network analysis. This yields a multi-layered variable system encompassing narrative input variables (such as development, people's livelihoods, culture, discipline, and external governance narratives), mediating variables (emotional resonance, policy perceptibility, governance credibility), latent variables (national confidence, institutional trust), and outcome variables (governance legitimacy, social cohesion), with variable relationships explicitly defined through directed causal pathways. This dataset emphasises theory-driven, mechanism-oriented and reproducible methodologies, serving computational social science, political communication, governance studies, Text-as-Data approaches, and causal inference teaching, replication and extension research. All variable definitions, path specifications and data processing logic are explicitly documented in accompanying explanatory files, facilitating comparative analysis across texts, years and nations.",
          "We leverage statistical and natural language processing (NLP) tools for a systematic analysis of triggers of state-led mass killings. The work advances the application of statistics and NLP in the social sciences and also contributes to scholarly efforts by empirically identifying the prominent triggering events of civilian mass killings. More specifically we seek to understand the timing and dynamics of political violence escalation, by examining systematically how certain types of political events may generate a government's policy of mass killing of civilians. The project provides pathways for the general application of promising NLP and statistical methods to the analysis of social event triggers as gleaned from big data repositories. Key objectives include: 1) To develop open source natural language processing (NLP) dictionaries and inference engines for event identification from texts, which are especially valuable for the analysis of political conflict and 2) Construct and validate a computational workflow to machine code millions of news articles (via NLP) for event identification, from a volume of data orders of magnitude larger than could be manually coded by a team of human readers. Having made considerable progress over multiple semesters, we share the methods and tools that have enabled us to overcome significant computational data analytics challenges.",

Powered by ML and NLP tools, this computational social science application processes a vast collection of news stories written in Spanish to track MCOs' violent presence. The unprecedented granularity of the data allows disaggregating daily-municipal information for 10 main MCOs comprising more than 200 specific criminal cells.",

To this end, SWEAT uses two additional wordsets, deemed to have opposite valence, to represent two different poles. We validate our approach and illustrate a case study to show the usefulness of the introduced measure.",

Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.",
          "A word's sentiment depends on the domain in which it is used. Computational social science research thus requires sentiment lexicons that are specific to the domains being studied. We combine domain-specific word embeddings with a label propagation framework to induce accurate domain-specific sentiment lexicons using small sets of seed words. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on inducing sentiment lexicons from domain-specific corpora and that our purely corpus-based approach outperforms methods that rely on hand-curated resources (e.g., WordNet). Using our framework, we induce and release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons we induce show that more than 5% of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.",
          "<title>Abstract</title> Quantum technologies are rapidly emerging as a strategic priority for global political powers. Yet little is known about how policymakers across countries perceive the security implications of quantum technologies, even though such perceptions shape policy priorities and public understanding of technological threats. Drawing on securitization theory, we analyze parliamentary speeches from 2010 to 2024 across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, and Singapore. Using computational social science tools, including a novel method based on large language models to quantify security emphasis, we report on three principal findings. First, the level of attention devoted to quantum technologies in general, as well as the intensity of the associated security rhetoric specifically, varies across legislatures. Second, security emphasis has increased over time in every parliament examined. Third, we provide an overview of the dominant topics in high-security debates, which include industrial espionage, military alliances, and foreign investment controls. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of these findings.",
          "The problem of comparing two bodies of text and searching for words that differ in their usage between them arises often in digital humanities and computational social science. This is commonly approached by training word embeddings on each corpus, aligning the vector spaces, and looking for words whose cosine distance in the aligned space is large. However, these methods often require extensive filtering of the vocabulary to perform well, and - as we show in this work - result in unstable, and hence less reliable, results. We propose an alternative approach that does not use vector space alignment, and instead considers the neighbors of each word. The method is simple, interpretable and stable. We demonstrate its effectiveness in 9 different setups, considering different corpus splitting criteria (age, gender and profession of tweet authors, time of tweet) and different languages (English, French and Hebrew).",
          "With more and more voices and opinions entering the public domain, a key challenge facing journalists and editors is maximizing the context of the information that is presented on news websites. In this paper, we argue that systems for exposing readers to the many aspects of societal debates should be grounded in methods and tools that can provide a fine-grained understanding of these debates. The present article thereby explores the conceptual transition from opinion observation to opinion facilitation by introducing and discussing the Penelope opinion facilitator: a proof-of-concept reading instrument for online news media that operationalizes emerging methods for the computational analysis of cultural conflict developed in the context of the H2020 ODYCCEUS project. It will be demonstrated how these methods can be combined into an instrument that complements the reading experience of the news website The Guardian by automatically interlinking news articles on the level of semantic frames. In linguistic theory, semantic frames are defined as coherent structures of related concepts. We thereby zoom in on instances of the “causation” frame, such as “climate change causes global warming,” and illustrate how a reading instrument that links articles based on such frames might reconfigure our readings of climate news coverage, with specific attention to the case of global warming controversies. Finally, we relate our findings to the context of the development of computational social science, and discuss pathways for the evaluation of the instrument, as well as for the future upscaling of qualitative analyses and close readings.",
          "Riveter provides a complete easy-to-use pipeline for analyzing verb connotations associated with entities in text corpora. We prepopulate the package with connotation frames of sentiment, power, and agency, which have demonstrated usefulness for capturing social phenomena, such as gender bias, in a broad range of corpora. For decades, lexical frameworks have been foundational tools in computational social science, digital humanities, and natural language processing, facilitating multifaceted analysis of text corpora. But working with verb-centric lexica specifically requires natural language processing skills, reducing their accessibility to other researchers. By organizing the language processing pipeline, providing complete lexicon scores and visualizations for all entities in a corpus, and providing functionality for users to target specific research questions, Riveter greatly improves the accessibility of verb lexica and can facilitate a broad range of future research.",
          "Off-the-shelf models are widely used by computational social science researchers to measure properties of text, such as sentiment.However, without access to source data it is difficult to account for domain shift, which represents a threat to validity. Here, we treat domain adaptation as a modular process that involves separate model producers and model consumers, and show how they can independently cooperate to facilitate more accurate measurements of text. We introduce two lightweight techniques for this scenario, and demonstrate that they reliably increase out-of-domain accuracy on four multi-domain text classification datasets when used with linear and contextual embedding models. We conclude with recommendations for model producers and consumers, and release models and replication code to accompany this paper.",
          "Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over 1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024. As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and linguistic framing in German journalistic texts. The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive and reproducible research in German-language NLP.",
          "Language on the Internet and social media varies due to time, geography, and social factors. For example, consider an online chat forum where people from different regions across the world interact. In such scenarios, it is important to track and detect regional variation in language. A person from the UK, who is in conversation with someone from the USA could say ``he is stuck in the lift'' to mean ''he is stuck in an elevator'', since the word \"lift\" means an \"elevator\" in the UK. Note that in the US, \"lift\" does not refer to an \"elevator\". Modeling such variation can allow for applications to prompt or suggest the intended meaning to the other participants of the conversation. In this thesis, we conduct two related lines of inquiry focusing on (a) language itself and the variation it manifests and (b) the user and what we can infer about them based on their language use on social media. First, we develop computational methods to track and detect changes in word usage, including semantic and syntactic variation. We examine three modalities: time, geography and domains. Specifically, we outline methods to use distributional word representations (word embeddings) to detect semantic variation in word usage. Our methods are scalable to large datasets, making them particularly suited for social media. Second, we turn our attention towards users. In particular, we model latent traits of users based on their everyday language use on social media. We develop latent factor models, that explicitly seek to build representations of each user based on their inferred latent traits. These models capture latent traits that serve as useful co-variates for a wide variety of tasks like predicting what topics users like on social media and the number of friends in their social circle. This work has broad applications in several fields like information retrieval, semantic web applications, socio-variational linguistics, and computational social science including digital health care and ad-targeting. | 115 pages",
          "Even though fine-tuned neural language models have been pivotal in enabling \"deep\" automatic text analysis, optimizing text representations for specific applications remains a crucial bottleneck. In this study, we look at this problem in the context of a task from computational social science, namely modeling pairwise similarities between political parties. Our research question is what level of structural information is necessary to create robust text representation, contrasting a strongly informed approach (which uses both claim span and claim category annotations) with approaches that forgo one or both types of annotation with document structure-based heuristics. Evaluating our models on the manifestos of German parties for the 2021 federal election. We find that heuristics that maximize within-party over between-party similarity along with a normalization step lead to reliable party similarity prediction, without the need for manual annotation.",
          "The application of text mining methods is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly within Humanities and Computational Social Sciences, as well as in a broader range of disciplines. This paper presents an analysis of gender bias in English song lyrics using topic modeling and bias measurement techniques. Leveraging BERTopic, we cluster a dataset of 537,553 English songs into distinct topics and analyze their temporal evolution. Our results reveal a significant thematic shift in song lyrics over time, transitioning from romantic themes to a heightened focus on the sexualization of women. Additionally, we observe a substantial prevalence of profanity and misogynistic content across various topics, with a particularly high concentration in the largest thematic cluster. To further analyse gender bias across topics and genres in a quantitative way, we employ the Single Category Word Embedding Association Test (SC-WEAT) to calculate bias scores for word embeddings trained on the most prominent topics as well as individual genres. The results indicate a consistent male bias in words associated with intelligence and strength, while appearance and weakness words show a female bias. Further analysis highlights variations in these biases across topics, illustrating the interplay between thematic content and gender stereotypes in song lyrics.",
          "Understanding complex societal events reported on the Web, such as military conflicts and political elections, is crucial in digital humanities, computational social science, and news analyses. While event extraction is a well-studied problem in natural language processing (NLP), there remains a gap in semantic event extraction methods that leverage event ontologies for capturing multifaceted events in knowledge graphs. In this article, we aim to compare two paradigms to address this task of semantic event extraction: the fine-tuning of traditional transformer-based models versus the use of large language models (LLMs). We exemplify these paradigms with two newly developed approaches: T-SEE for transformer-based and L-SEE for LLM-based semantic event extraction. We discuss their complementary strengths and shortcomings to understand the needs and solutions required for semantic event extraction. For comparison, both approaches employ the same dual-stage architecture; the first stages focus on multilabel event classification, and the second on relation extraction. While T-SEE utilises a span prediction transformer model, L-SEE prompts an LLM for event classification and relation extraction, providing the potential event classes and properties. We assess the performances of T-SEE and L-SEE on two novel datasets sourced from DBpedia and Wikidata, and we perform an extensive error analysis. Our work makes substantial contributions to (i) the integration of Semantic Web technologies and NLP, particularly in the underexplored domain of semantic event extraction, and (ii) the understanding of how LLMs can further enhance semantic event extraction and what challenges need to be considered in comparison to traditional approaches.",
          "The phenomenon of colexification describes occurrences in natural language in which two concepts are expressed by the same word in at least one language. We deploy this linguistic principle to construct a theory-driven text analysis method. Compared to many state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, this method is fully interpretable, allowing precise insights into the structure of the model. Such theory-driven approaches are increasingly in demand since when using other large NLP models it is difficult for developers to understand a models’ dynamics and implications thereof. Furthermore, the proposed method is domain-independent because it is constructed on the language-layer itself as compared to the majority of state-of-the-art methods, which are trained using large corpora of texts.The text analysis method here proposed is based on a word similarity measure built on top of a colexification network, i.e. a network of concepts linked by occurrences of colexification. Inspired by similar approaches in other domains, we compute the word similarity measure as the stationary visiting distribution in each node and validate it using several of the most used word similarity datasets in NLP. The results show that the colexification-based method significantly outperforms other word and graph embedding approaches in the task of word similarity prediction. After the validation of the word similarity metric we define a text similarity measure inspired by a state-of-the-art approach to the same task. Performing various experiments based on databases of English texts, we validate the measure by showing that it is able to distinguish text excerpts on the basis of their genre, author and text of origin with reasonable accuracy. We compare the results of the method with the ones of a standard NLP approach on the genre recognition task and find that the two models reach comparable performances.The text analysis method developed in this work allows us to validate the hypothesis that colexification occurrences encode semantic relationships between concepts. Furthermore, we show that a colexification-based approach to NLP has significant merits in various text analysis tasks, leading to meaningful insights. For instance, we perform a historical analysis of American English fiction literature, showing that the style and content of fiction literature has become more diverse over time, with the rate of change increasing particularly sharply in recent decades. These insights can be linked to other findings in computational social science, suggesting that the flux of cultural content has been increasing during the last decades.",
          "More than ever before, marginalised communities are gaining a platform on social media to tell their stories, question authority figures, and find common ground. Subaltern narratives in Indian social media will be investigated in this study by integrating machine learning with qualitative discourse analysis. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including text categorisation, topic modelling, and sentiment analysis, the study uncovers similarities and emotional undercurrents throughout social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook. Based on annotated subaltern content, the authors propose a new model that could detect instances of gender, caste, religion, and tribe marginalisation. In addition, the intrinsic power dynamics and sociopolitical background of the online talks are dissected using narrative analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The findings shed light on the manner in which marginalised communities in India navigate digital platforms, revealing patterns of resistance, identity formation, and structural silence. By drawing attention to the need for ethically sound and culturally sensitive digital research, as well as the potential of machine learning to amplify under-represented perspectives, the work contributes to postcolonial theory and computational social science.",
          "While much computational work on fiction has focused on works in the literary canon, user-created fanfiction presents a unique opportunity to study an ecosystem of literary production and consumption, embodying qualities both of large-scale literary data (55 billion tokens) and also a social network (with over 2 million users).We present several empirical analyses of this data in order to illustrate the range of affordances it presents to research in NLP, computational social science and the digital humanities.We find that fanfiction deprioritizes main protagonists in comparison to canonical texts, has a statistically significant difference in attention allocated to female characters, and offers a framework for developing models of reader reactions to stories.",
          "Text-based data sources like narratives and stories have become increasingly popular as critical insight generator in energy research and social science. However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure. We verify the theoretical and epistemological fit of the proposed nested methodology through a meta-analysis of a state-of-the-art bibliographic database on energy policy and computational social science. We find that the nested application contributes to the literature gap on the need for multidisciplinary polyvalence methodologies that can systematically include qualitative evidence into policymaking.",
          "Abstract The Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) has provided policy scholars with a valuable method to gain empirical insight into the power of narratives in the policy process. However, a significant limitation of the NPF has been its ability to deploy this framework on large N datasets due to the labor‐intensive nature of collecting narrative data. In recent years, NPF scholars have turned to computational social science tools to address this challenge. This study builds upon this emerging body of literature and our previous work, which uses sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique, to evaluate the use of the angel/devil shift across coalitions before and after a major policy change. We examined Tweets that included the terms “fracking” and “New York” before and after the introduction of a moratorium. While sentiment analysis allowed us to gain insight into the narrative structure of the fracking policy discourse space, the labor involved in hand‐coding Twitter users into neutral‐, pro‐, or anti‐fracking groups was onerous. This project aims to supplement our natural language processing method by employing supervised machine learning techniques to increase the universe of respondents. We hand‐coded 500 Twitter users into neutral‐, pro‐, or anti‐fracking groups and trained a much larger dataset using an extreme gradient boost algorithm to classify a broader corpus of Tweets. This enabled us to expand the number of Tweets used in the analyses. We then applied sentiment analysis on this newly classified larger dataset to reveal differences in the pro‐fracking and anti‐fracking advocacy coalitions. By using machine learning to classify pro and con Tweets, we gained the ability to achieve significantly greater insight into how these two subgroups employed different narrative and linguistic devices in their Twitter discussions about fracking.

          "Neighbourhoods have been described by the UK Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government as the \"building blocks of public service society\". Despite this, difficulties in data collection combined with the concept's subjective nature have left most countries lacking official neighbourhood definitions. This issue has implications not only for policy, but for the field of computational social science as a whole (with many studies being forced to use administrative units as proxies despite the fact that these bear little connection to resident perceptions of social boundaries). In this paper we illustrate that the mass linguistic datasets now available on the internet need only be combined with relatively simple linguistic computational models to produce definitions that are not only probabilistic and dynamic, but do not require a priori knowledge of neighbourhood names.",
          "In response to the limitations of traditional static and subjective methods, this study pioneers an AI-driven framework for assessing media convergence competitiveness by leveraging natural language processing and machine learning. Analyzing a large-scale dataset of YouTube comments from January to June 2024, the research employs sentiment classification models—including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—with Gradient Boosting demonstrating superior performance. The findings reveal that the proposed framework not only outperforms conventional approaches in accuracy and consistency but also captures nuanced public sentiments and their temporal dynamics, uncovering a dual pattern of instant emotional reactions and reflective long-term evaluations. This provides policymakers and media practitioners with a scalable, data-driven tool for real-time assessment and evidence-based strategy formulation. Ultimately, the study underscores the transformative potential of integrating computational social science with media studies, significantly enhancing the precision and predictive power of competitiveness evaluation beyond qualitative paradigms.",
          "The article describes the development of a dish search engine for digital restaurant menus in Kyiv, focusing on Ukrainian-speaking users. The system integrates modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods such as lemmatization, text classification, and data filtering, alongside Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), specialized ingredient dictionaries, a database, and an ontological knowledge base designed in Protégé. Using rules from the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and logical inference through the Pellet reasoning engine, the system performs semantic analysis of user queries, automatically identifying relationships between dish components, and improving search relevance.The search algorithm utilizes a multi-layered approach that combines machine learning, logical reasoning, and rule-based filtering. User queries, often containing informal or varied phrasing, are first processed by a large language model (LLM) to identify and standardize key terms. The LLM is enhanced with predefined dictionaries (e.g., for cheese types like “mascarpone”, “brie,” or “cheddar”) and connected to an ontological knowledge base, which enriches the query with semantic relationships. RAG extends this functionality by automatically expanding search terms to include synonyms or related concepts, such as linking “pasta” to “macaroni” or “spaghetti.”The study incorporates principles of computational social science to analyze semi-structured data from digital restaurant menus, such as the popularity of dishes and their ingredients, as well as the impact of restaurant location on pricing. The data highlights trends in customer preferences and provides actionable insights for optimizing restaurant menus.The developed system successfully integrates NLP techniques, logical reasoning, and structured data storage, achieving high accuracy and relevance in search results. By incorporating an LLM, RAG, and ontological reasoning, the system demonstrates the potential for significantly enhancing customer-oriented services in the restaurant industry through advanced data analysis and semantic search tools.",
          "This study investigates cross-cultural differences in public perception of mobility electrification by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to social media discourse in Germany and China. Using a large language model, we conducted sentiment analysis and zero-shot thematic classification on over 10,000 posts to explore how citizens in each country engage with the topic of electric mobility. Results reveal that while infrastructure readiness is a dominant concern in both contexts, German discourse places greater emphasis on environmental impact, often reflecting skepticism toward sustainability claims. In contrast, Chinese discussions highlight technological advancement and infrastructure expansion, with comparatively limited focus on environmental concerns. Sentiment in Germany tends to be more reserved and analytical, whereas Chinese discourse appears more expressive and emotionally varied. These findings underscore the importance of culturally tailored policy and communication strategies in supporting the public acceptance of electric mobility. By demonstrating how large-scale social media data can be used to analyze public sentiment across linguistic and cultural contexts, this study contributes methodologically to the emerging field of computational social science and offers practical insights for mobility policy in diverse national settings.",
          "Narratives play a vital role in shaping public perceptions and policy on emerging technologies like quantum technology (QT).

We employ a computational social science approach, combining BERTopic modeling with qualitative assessment to extract themes and narratives. The findings show that public discourse on QT reflects prevailing social and political agendas, focusing on technical and commercial potential, global conflicts, national strategies, and social issues. Media articles provide the most balanced coverage, while business and government discourses often overlook societal implications. We discuss the ramifications for integrating QT into society and the need for well-informed public discourse.",
          "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a supervised machine learning task that finds various applications in automated content analysis, as the identification of entities is vital for understanding public discourse. However, sometimes the standard NER labels are not specific enough for a given domain. We introduce Public Entity Recognition (PER). PER is a domain-specific version of NER, that is trained for five entity types that are common to public discourse: politicians, parties, authorities, media, and journalists. PER can be used for pre-processing documents, in a pipeline with other classifiers or directly for analyzing information in texts. The taxonomy for PER is taken from the database of (German) public speakers and aims at low-threshold integration into computational social science research. We experiment with different training settings, involving weakly supervised training and training on manually annotated data. We evaluate multilingual transformer models of different sizes against rule-based entity matching and find that the models do not only outperform the baseline but also reach competitive absolute scores of around .8 and higher in F1. We further test for generalization and domain adaptation. We show that with only around 100–150 additional sentences, the model can be adapted to new languages.",

          "Abstract Online debates and debate spheres challenge our assumptions about democracy, politics, journalism, trust, and truth in ways that make them a necessary object of study. In the present article, we argue that the study of online arguments can benefit from an interdisciplinary approach that combines computational methods for text analysis with conceptual models of opinion dynamics. The article thereby seeks to make a conceptual and methodological contribution to the field by highlighting the role of domain-crossing causal statements in debates of societal interest, and by providing a method for automatically mining such statements from textual corpora on the web. The article illustrates the relevance of this approach for the study of online debates by means of a case study in which we analyse cross-cutting statements on climate change and energy technologies from the comment section of the online newspaper The Guardian. In support of this case study, we use data and methods that are made openly available through the Penelope ecosystem of tools and techniques for computational social science.",
          "Community resource inequities and undetected infrastructure vulnerabilities cost municipalities billions annually, with disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities. Current computational approaches to community needs assessment suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on aggregate-level analysis that obscures granular community expressions, and they implement sophisticated computational tools that remain inaccessible to stakeholders without technical expertise. This creates what we term the Community-Computational Gap—a persistent divide where domain experts with vital contextual knowledge cannot access the analytical tools they need, while computational experts develop models without sufficient community context. This dissertation addresses these challenges through a novel methodological framework for fine-grained utterance-level classification of community discourse. We demonstrate that individual units of communication contain sufficient linguistic patterns to accurately detect both present and future community needs without relying on metadata or aggregated approaches. Unlike existing methods that operate at neighborhood or census-tract levels, our approach preserves the contextual integrity of individual expressions while enabling more precise signal extraction from social media noise. Our technical implementation achieves unprecedented accuracy—94\\% for existing community needs and assets and 82\\% for future infrastructural issues—through two specialized computational models validated on novel annotated datasets: 3,511 Reddit conversations for community needs assessment and 2,662 social web instances related to future infrastructure concerns. Our linguistic analysis reveals distinctive discourse patterns where needs-related conversations exhibit specific pain points and calls to action, while asset-related discussions emphasize local resources and community capabilities. To bridge the Community-Computational Gap, we develop two complementary platforms: Citizenly, a mobile application enabling community-driven data collection and visualization, and CommuniDI, an integrated framework leveraging large language models that enables non-technical stakeholders to create sophisticated classifiers without programming requirements. Through mixed-methods evaluation, we demonstrate that this democratization—the systematic transfer of analytical capabilities to local stakeholders—maintains technical rigor (with F1 scores consistently exceeding 85\\% across diverse datasets) while significantly lowering barriers to computational social science research. This work represents a fundamental shift from computational tools \\textit{for} communities to computational tools \\textit{with} communities, enabling more equitable and effective approaches to addressing local challenges.",
          "Abstract This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends—beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families—word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches—and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.",
          "Word similarity has many applications to social science and cultural analytics tasks like measuring meaning change over time and making sense of contested terms. Yet traditional similarity methods based on cosine similarity between word embeddings cannot capture the context-dependent, asymmetrical, polysemous nature of semantic similarity. We propose a new measure of similarity, Word Confusion, that reframes semantic similarity in terms of feature-based classification confusion. Word Confusion is inspired by Tversky's suggestion that similarity features be chosen dynamically. Here we train a classifier to map contextual embeddings to word identities and use the classifier confusion (the probability of choosing a confounding word c instead of the correct target word t) as a measure of the similarity of c and t. The set of potential confounding words acts as the chosen features. Our method is comparable to cosine similarity in matching human similarity judgments across several datasets (MEN, WirdSim353, and SimLex), and can measure similarity using predetermined features of interest. We demonstrate our model's ability to make use of dynamic features by applying it to test a hypothesis about changes in the 18th C. meaning of the French word \"revolution\" from popular to state action during the French Revolution. We hope this reimagining of semantic similarity will inspire the development of new tools that better capture the multi-faceted and dynamic nature of language, advancing the fields of computational social science and cultural analytics and beyond.",
          "Global cities act as influential hubs in the networked world. Their city brands, which are projected by the global news media, are becoming sustainable resources in various global competitions and cooperations. This study adopts the research paradigm of computational social science to assess and compare the city brand attention, positivity, and influence of ten Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) Alpha+ global cities, along with their dimensional structures, based on combining the cognitive and affective theoretical perspectives on the frameworks of the Anholt global city brand dimension system, the big data of global news knowledge graph in Google’s Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), and the technologies of word-embedding semantic mining and clustering analysis. The empirical results show that the overall values and dimensional structures of city brand influence of global cities form distinct levels and clusters, respectively. Although global cities share a common structural characteristic of city brand influence of the dimensions of presence and potential being most prominent, Western and Eastern global cities differentiate in the clustering of dimensional structures of city brand attention, positivity, and influence. City brand attention is more important than city brand positivity in improving the city brand influence of global cities. The preferences of the global news media over global city brands fits the nature of global cities.",

          "Off-the-shelf models are widely used by computational social science researchers to measure properties of text, such as sentiment. However, without access to source data it is difficult to account for domain shift, which represents a threat to validity. Here, we treat domain adaptation as a modular process that involves separate model producers and model consumers, and show how they can independently cooperate to facilitate more accurate measurements of text. We introduce two lightweight techniques for this scenario, and demonstrate that they reliably increase out-of-domain accuracy on four multi-domain text classification datasets when used with linear and contextual embedding models. We conclude with recommendations for model producers and consumers, and release models and replication code to accompany this paper.",
          "Social science research (communication studies in particular) often involves measuring the soft power of social entities from the related big data of media texts. This work proposes a soft power measurement framework that integrates the domain-expertise-driven conceptualization of the traditional social science paradigm and the data-driven operationalization of the computational social science paradigm. Based on the geometric projections of word vectors from the social entity keywords to the soft power dimension keywords, the weights of social entity keywords in the full-sample media texts are projected to the corresponding soft power dimensions in the high-dimensional word-embedding semantic space and accumulated to the total and dimensional values of the soft power of social entities respectively. We demonstrate the applicability, compatibility, computational complexity, validity, adaptability, and scalability of the proposed framework by showing a standard instantiation (measuring the national image carrying capacity of Chinese elite private entrepreneurs from the full-sample WeChat articles, each of which has more than 100,000 unique views) and a variational instantiation (measuring the city brand influence of global cities from the big data of the Global News Knowledge Graph in the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) of Google) of the proposed framework.",

          "Abstract Accurate, reliable and updated information support effective decision-making by reducing uncertainty and enabling informed choices. Multiple crises threaten the sustainability of our societies and pose at risk the planetary boundaries, hence requiring usable and operational knowledge. Natural-language processing tools facilitate data collection, extraction and analysis processes. They expand knowledge utilization capabilities by improving access to reliable sources in shorter time. They also identify patterns of similarities and contrasts across diverse contexts. We apply general and domain-specific large language models (LLMs) to two case studies and we document appropriate uses and shortcomings of these tools for two tasks: classification and sentiment analysis of climate and sustainability documents. We study both statistical and prompt-based methods. In the first case study, we use LLMs to assess whether climate pledges trigger cascade effects in other sustainability dimensions. In the second use case, we use LLMs to identify interactions between the sustainable development goals and detects the direction of their links to frame meaningful policy implications. We find that LLMs are successful at processing, classifying and summarizing heterogeneous text-based data helping practitioners and researchers accessing. LLMs detect strong concerns from emerging economies in addressing food security, water security and urban challenges as primary issues. Developed economies, instead, focus their pledges on the energy transition and climate finance. We also detect and document four main limits along the knowledge production chain: interpretability, external validity, replicability and usability. These risks threaten the usability of findings and can lead to failures in the decision-making process. We recommend risk mitigation strategies to improve transparency and literacy on artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to complex policy problems. Our work presents a critical but empirically grounded application of LLMs to climate and sustainability questions and suggests avenues to further expand controlled and risk-aware AI-powered computational social sciences.",
          "Many tasks in text-based computational social science (CSS) involve the classification of political statements into categories based on a domain-specific codebook. In order to be useful for CSS analysis, these categories must be fine-grained. The typically skewed distribution of fine-grained categories, however, results in a challenging classification problem on the NLP side. This paper proposes to make use of the hierarchical relations among categories typically present in such codebooks:e.g., markets and taxation are both subcategories of economy, while borders is a subcategory of security. We use these ontological relations as prior knowledge to establish additional constraints on the learned model, thusimproving performance overall and in particular for infrequent categories. We evaluate several lightweight variants of this intuition by extending state-of-the-art transformer-based textclassifiers on two datasets and multiple languages. We find the most consistent improvement for an approach based on regularization.",
          "We introduce string2string, an open-source library that offers a comprehensive suite of efficient algorithms for a broad range of string-to-string problems. It includes traditional algorithmic solutions as well as recent advanced neural approaches to tackle various problems in string alignment, distance measurement, lexical and semantic search, and similarity analysis -- along with several helpful visualization tools and metrics to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of these methods. Notable algorithms featured in the library include the Smith-Waterman algorithm for pairwise local alignment, the Hirschberg algorithm for global alignment, the Wagner-Fisher algorithm for edit distance, BARTScore and BERTScore for similarity analysis, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for lexical search, and Faiss for semantic search. Besides, it wraps existing efficient and widely-used implementations of certain frameworks and metrics, such as sacreBLEU and ROUGE, whenever it is appropriate and suitable. Overall, the library aims to provide extensive coverage and increased flexibility in comparison to existing libraries for strings. It can be used for many downstream applications, tasks, and problems in natural-language processing, bioinformatics, and computational social sciences. It is implemented in Python, easily installable via pip, and accessible through a simple API.

          "With the rise of computational social science, analyzing sociological problems using computational methods has attracted widespread attention. In recent years, sentiment analysis has become a research hotspot in computational social science. But existing researches concentrate on modern text, such as product reviews and microblogging, and hardly involve the analysis of ancient literature. In this paper, we propose a model TL-PCO based on transfer learning to classify ancient literature, then through sentiments in ancient literature we can understand social and cultural development in that era. Our model utilizes the knowledge of ancient literature itself and the corresponding modern translation. Through two proposed functions based on transfer learning we can get two kinds of features. With the addition of features from ancient literature itself, three classifiers can be trained and then vote for the final category. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the dataset of Chinese poems in Tang Dynasty. Moreover, the different periods of Tang Dynasty and different genres are analyzed in detail. Compared with the analysis of social history, the results confirmed the effectiveness of this method.",

This work aims to enable automatic and accurate ad-hoc retrieval of comments discussing a trending topic from a large corpus, using only a handful of seed news articles.",
          "We use commercially available text analysis technology to process interview text data from a computational social science study. We find that topical clustering and terminological enrichment provide for convenient exploration and quantification of the responses. This makes it possible to generate and test hypotheses and to compare textual and non-textual variables, and saves analyst effort. We encourage studies in social science to use text analysis, especially for exploratory open-ended studies. We discuss how replicability requirements are met by text analysis technology. We note that the most recent learning models are not designed with transparency in mind, and that research requires a model to be editable and its decisions to be explainable. The tools available today, such as the one used in the present study, are not built for processing interview texts. While many of the variables under consideration are quantifiable using lexical statistics, we find that some interesting and potentially valuable features are difficult or impossible to automatise reliably at present. We note that there are some potentially interesting applications for traditional natural language processing mechanisms such as named entity recognition and anaphora resolution in this application area. We conclude with a suggestion for language technologists to investigate the challenge of processing interview data comprehensively, especially the interplay between question and response, and we encourage social science researchers not to hesitate to use text analysis tools, especially for the exploratory phase of processing interview data.?",

          "A word's sentiment depends on the domain in which it is used. Computational social science research thus requires sentiment lexicons that are specific to the domains being studied. We combine domain-specific word embeddings with a label propagation framework to induce accurate domain-specific sentiment lexicons using small sets of seed words, achieving state-of-the-art performance competitive with approaches that rely on hand-curated resources. Using our framework we perform two large-scale empirical studies to quantify the extent to which sentiment varies across time and between communities. We induce and release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons show that more than 5% of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.",

          "This study investigates cross-cultural differences in public perception of mobility electrification by applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to social media discourse in Germany and China. Using a large language model (LLM), this study conducted sentiment analysis and zero-shot text classification on over 10,000 posts to explore how citizens in each country engage with the topic of electric mobility. Results reveal that while infrastructure readiness is a dominant concern in both contexts, German discourse places greater emphasis on environmental impact, often reflecting skepticism toward sustainability claims. On the other hand, Chinese discussions highlight technological advancement and infrastructure expansion, with comparatively limited focus on environmental concerns. These findings show the importance of culturally tailored policy and communication strategies in supporting the public acceptance of electric mobility. By demonstrating how artificial intelligence-driven large-scale social media data analysis can be used to analyze public sentiment across linguistic and cultural contexts, this study contributes methodologically to the emerging field of computational social science and offers practical insights for mobility policy in diverse national settings.",

Still, access to full-text news corpora remains challenging due to high costs and the limited availability of free alternatives. This paper presents a novel Python package (gdeltnews) that reconstructs full-text newspaper articles at near-zero cost by leveraging the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Web News NGrams 3.0 dataset. Our method merges overlapping n-grams extracted from global online news to rebuild complete articles. We validate the approach on a benchmark set of 2211 articles from major U.S. news outlets, achieving up to 95% text similarity against original articles based on Levenshtein and SequenceMatcher metrics. Our tool facilitates economic forecasting, computational social science, information science, and natural language processing applications by enabling free and large-scale access to full-text news data.",

          "A central concern in Computational Social Sciences (CSS) is fairness: where the role of NLP is to scale up text analysis to large corpora, the quality of automatic analyses should be as independent as possible of textual properties. We analyze the performance of a state-of-the-art neural model on the task of political claims detection (i.e., the identification of forward-looking statements made by political actors) and identify a strong frequency bias: claims made by frequent actors are recognized better. We propose two simple debiasing methods which mask proper names and pronouns during training of the model, thus removing personal information bias. We find that (a) these methods significantly decrease frequency bias while keeping the overall performance stable; and (b) the resulting models improve when evaluated in an out-of-domain setting.",
          "Cross-cultural differences and similarities are common in cross-lingual natural language understanding, especially for research in social media. For instance, people of distinct cultures often hold different opinions on a single named entity. Also, understanding slang terms across languages requires knowledge of cross-cultural similarities. In this paper, we study the problem of computing such cross-cultural differences and similarities. We present a lightweight yet effective approach, and evaluate it on two novel tasks: 1) mining cross-cultural differences of named entities and 2) finding similar terms for slang across languages. Experimental results show that our framework substantially outperforms a number of baseline methods on both tasks. The framework could be useful for machine translation applications and research in computational social science.",

          "Chinese texts often feature a substantial volume of normative content, and their analysis has increasingly become a focal point in recent semantic analysis endeavors. Enhancing the effectiveness of text classification and clustering is pivotal in unveiling the intricate semantics within extensive textual data. Empirical research within the realm of computational social science has underscored the need for improved explanatory power when it comes to general text clustering methods applied to normative texts. This study introduces an innovative hierarchical clustering method that incorporates part-of-speech (POS) features and pioneers a novel semantic network model. It achieves this by amalgamating a POS-based feature weight calculation method with hierarchical clustering techniques. To assess its efficacy, the method is rigorously evaluated across three diverse text datasets, encompassing normative reports, news articles, and social media content. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the superior performance of the POS-HC method, surpassing the traditional TF and TF-IDF feature extraction methods in terms of clustering accuracy, and surpassing some existing clustering methods. Furthermore, its classification effectiveness exhibits notable advantages, particularly in the semantic classification of normative texts.",

          "Abstract—Current events such as the Park51 Project in downtown Manhattan create “critical discourse moments,” explosions of discourse around a topic that can be exploited for data gathering. Policymakers have a need to understand the dynamics of public discussion in real time. Human values, which are cognitively related to attitudes and serve as reference points in moral argument, are important indicators of what’s at stake in a public controversy. This work shows that it is possible to link values data with reader behavior to infer values implicit in a topical corpus, and that it is possible to automate this process using machine learning. Thus, this work represents a preliminary attempt at scalable computational social science using techniques from natural language processing. Keywords-human values; natural language processing; crowdsourcing",

Furthermore, the political debates captured in these transcripts facilitate research on political discourse from a computational social science perspective. In this paper we release the first version of a newly compiled corpus from Basque parliamentary transcripts. The corpus is characterized by heavy Basque-Spanish code-switching, and represents an interesting resource to study political discourse in contrasting languages such as Basque and Spanish. We enrich the corpus with metadata related to relevant attributes of the speakers and speeches (language, gender, party...) and process the text to obtain named entities and lemmas. The obtained metadata is then used to perform a detailed corpus analysis which provides interesting insights about the language use of the Basque political representatives across time, parties and gender.",
          "Static word embeddings are ubiquitous in computational social science applications and contribute to practical decision-making in a variety of fields including law and healthcare. However, assessing the statistical uncertainty in downstream conclusions drawn from word embedding statistics has remained challenging. When using only point estimates for embeddings, researchers have no streamlined way of assessing the degree to which their model selection criteria or scientific conclusions are subject to noise due to sparsity in the underlying data used to generate the embeddings. We introduce a method to obtain approximate, easy-to-use, and scalable reconstruction error variance estimates for GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), one of the most widely used word embedding models, using an analytical approximation to a multivariate normal model. To demonstrate the value of embeddings with variance (GloVe-V), we illustrate how our approach enables principled hypothesis testing in core word embedding tasks, such as comparing the similarity between different word pairs in vector space, assessing the performance of different models, and analyzing the relative degree of ethnic or gender bias in a corpus using different word lists.",

          "Computational social science has witnessed a shift from pure theoretical to empirical agent-based models (ABMs) grounded in data-driven correlations between behavioral factors defining agents' decisions. There is a strong urge to go beyond theoretical ABMs with behavioral theories setting stylized rules that guide agents' actions, especially when it concerns policy-related simulations. However, it remains unclear to what extent theory-driven ABMs mislead, if at all, a choice of a policy when compared to the outcomes of models with empirical micro-foundations. This is especially relevant for pro-environmental policies that increasingly rely on quantifying cumulative effects of individual behavioral changes, where ABMs are so helpful. We propose a comparison framework to address this methodological dilemma, which quantitatively explores the gap in predictions between theory- and data-driven ABMs. Inspired by the existing theory-driven model, ORVin-T, which studies the individual choice between organic and conventional products, we design a survey to collect data on individual preferences and purchasing decisions. We then use this extensive empirical microdata to build an empirical twin, ORVin-E, replacing the theoretical assumptions and secondary aggregated data used to parametrize agents' decision strategies with our empirical survey data. We compare the models in terms of key outputs, perform sensitivity analysis, and explore three policy scenarios. We observe that the theory-driven model predicts the shifts to organic consumption as accurately as the ABM with empirical micro-foundations at both aggregated and individual scales. There are slight differences (Â±5%) between the estimations of the two models with regard to different behavioral change scenarios: increasing conventional tax, launching organic social-informational campaigns, and their combination. Our findings highlight the goodness of fit and usefulness of theoretical modeling efforts, at least in the case of incremental behavioral change. It sheds light on the conditions when theory-driven and data-driven models are aligned and on the value of empirical data for studying systemic changes.",
          "This paper develops a multi-agent computational model to simulate the effects of designer-user interactions on the design of products, interactions that are both direct and indirect.The architecture of an agent-based computational system is described, with emphasis on how it models situated design computing and cognition, including both designer and consumer agents.Indicative results obtained from running simulations are presented.The primary contribution is to demonstrate that situated design computing and cognition can be modelled using Computational Social Science methods.",
          "With agent-based models, computational social scientists want to explain the emergence of social phenomena, such as ethnic and social segregation, opinion polarization, the rise of mass protests, economic and political cycles, or the ups and downs of epidemic spreading of infectious diseases. While modeling, researchers may experiment with theories and assumptions about the behavior of individuals and link them to the societal level through computer simulation of repeated social interaction of many artificial individuals. Similarly, researchers play with institutional settings modifying the context in which agents interact. Such agent-based models can be seen as a tool to explore multi-player games where actors' rationality is bounded. In both senses, agent-based modeling is intrinsically theory driven. The strength of agent-based modeling is the quantitative causal understanding of emergence through complex nonlinear dynamics on the macro-level. Therefore, methods of validation with empirical data are less easily specified and more diverse than in variable-based regression models. In particular, the nature of the data–theory link is closely related to the main research purpose and can deviate from validation. Nevertheless, agent-based models are to explain real-world phenomena, and thus a useful model should have a reflection in empirical data and the other way round. This chapter is about how agent-based modeling can be data-driven. This includes (1) the consideration of data structure in the model building process, (2) a parallel data exploration searching and quantifying \"stylized facts\" to later use for validation, (3) the iteration of model revisions to increase its replicative validity, and (4) the calibration of model parameters with data for forecasting or counterfactual simulations. These aspects of data-driven agent-based modeling will be exemplified by two examples about segregation and polarization.",
          "Approaches to modeling social phenomena vary on a continuum from simple models, in which causality is clear and parameters few, to realistic, high-fidelity models designed to capture the most detailed system behavior possible in a specific setting. Anthropologists have produced both simple and high-fidelity models. The focus of this article is on high-fidelity modeling in anthropology and the special challenge its complexity presents for model comparison. Useful model comparison requires docking, or rendering models comparable, and the author presents a framework for docking based on the work of Axelrod, and Cioffi-Revilla and Gotts. Docking not only renders models more comparable, allowing for more traditional theory testing, but it also sharpens the discussion about the ontology of anthropological phenomena and how they are best represented as theories and models.",
          "The paper proposes a simple model of multi-sectorial growth along classical, computational and evolutionary lines where equilibrium in prices and quantities is not presumed, but dynamically attained by the systematic, decentralized operation of economic competition over time. The model thus provides a parsimonious and innovative solution to the classic problem of the dynamic convergence of a competitive economy to equilibrium. The model views economic competition as a statistical process over time that results in the dynamic equalization of prices, industry supply and demand, and inter-industrial profit rates in the aggregate. It is disaggregated by firms under an evolving heterogeneous technology operating under alternative micro-foundations, without any recourse to utility or profit maximization, but instead based on reproduction as fundamental closure. In order to relate macro-level patterns to micro-level observations over time, the theoretical framework re-conceptualizes equilibrium as a stationary property of statistical distributions of micro-economic variables, which allows a more realistic empirical description of the economy beyond the conventional notion of equilibrium as a single-point, rest state. The model generates a variety of stylized facts as macro-level emergent outcomes of the competitive process: price dispersion around the competitive value, a spectrum of profitability differentials respecting cost differences, evolutionary selection of the lowest-cost firm, tent-shaped distributions of profit and growth rates that are consistent with the empirical evidence, cost-plus markup pricing, downward-sloping demand curves, and industry-level business cycles in prices and inventories.",
          "Social simulation-an emerging field of computational social science-has progressed from simple toy models to increasingly realistic models of complex social systems, such as agent-based models where heterogeneous agents interact with changing natural or artificial environments.These larger, multidisciplinary projects require a scientific research methodology distinct from, say, simpler social simulations with more limited scope, intentionally minimal complexity, and typically under a single investigator.This paper proposes a methodology for complex social simulations-particularly inter-and multi-disciplinary socio-natural systems with multi-level architecture-based on a succession of models akin to but distinct from the late Imre Lakatos' notion of a 'research programme'.The proposed methodology is illustrated through examples from the Mason-Smithsonian project on agent-based models of the rise and fall of polities in Inner Asia.While the proposed methodology requires further development, so far it has proven valuable for advancing the scientific objectives of the project and avoiding some pitfalls.",
          "Behavioral experiments are rarely used as an empirical strategy in computational social science, where empirical studies typically focus on analyzing large-scale digital trace data. We argue that behavioral experiments have a role in computational social science, in particular in combination with agent-based modeling – a key theoretical strategy in computational social science. We highlight three ways in which behavioral experiments can contribute to theory building in computational social science: by testing macro-level predictions from agent-based models, by evaluating behavioral assumptions on which these models are based, and by calibrating agent-based models. We illustrate these points through three examples from our work concerned with the emergence of conventions.",
          "This paper presents an approach to studying how conceptual blind spots emerge in complex system engineering projects--i.e. when the value systems and conceptual schemas of collaborating teams are incongruous and not seen. It uses methods derived from computational social science founded on agent-based modeling using social agents. The paper describes the agents and their capabilities, and also a NetLogo implementation of an abstracted version of a space launch system. Agents choose how much to invest in discovering unknown dependencies. Results are portrayed in a Design dependency matrix.",
          "Since 1998, the Department of Energy/NNSA National Laboratories have invested millions in strategies for assessing the credibility of computational science and engineering (CSE) models used in high consequence decision making. The answer? There is no answer. There's a process--and a lot of politics. The importance of model evaluation (verification, validation, uncertainty quantification, and assessment) increases in direct proportion to the significance of the model as input to a decision. Other fields, including computational social science, can learn from the experience of the national laboratories. Some implications for evaluating 'low cognition agents'. Epistemology considers the question, How do we know what we [think we] know? What makes Western science special in producing reliable, predictive knowledge about the world? V&V takes epistemology out of the realm of thought and puts it into practice. What is the role of modeling and simulation in the production of reliable, credible scientific knowledge about the world? What steps, investments, practices do I pursue to convince myself that the model I have developed is producing credible knowledge?",
          "Computational Social Science is an emerging discipline which provides better opportunity to collect, analyze and interpret big data sets on different aspects of human behaviour.The quantum expansion of digital technologies and the dependence on them in everyday life has generated huge diverse and innovative big data sets on social phenomena which otherwise was beyond the reach and expectation of social scientists.The new sources of data, type, quantity, etc. required a interdisciplinary approach for optimizing the data usage.In the new discipline, the research from collaborating subject domains employ agent based models to derive stories from big data.The agent based computational social science has ensured collaboration between social scientists and computer scientists for tapping and for drawing meaningful conclusions from the big data created through the use of digital technologies.",
          "The use of simulations by social scientists in exploring theories and hypotheses is well documented. As computer systems have grown in capacity, so have interests of social scientists in executing larger simulations. Social scientists often approach their simulation design from the top down by selecting an Entity-Based Model (EBM) framework from those that are readily available, thus limiting modeling capability to the available frameworks. Ultimately, the framework is dependent upon what is at the bottom, the hardware architecture that serves as the foundation of the computing system. Parallel hardware architecture supports the simultaneous execution of a problem split into multiple pieces. Thus, the problem is solved faster in parallel. In this thesis, a selection of parallel hardware architectures is examined with a goal of providing support for EBMs. The hardware's capability to support parallelization of EBMs is described and contrasted. A simple EBM is tested to illustrate these capabilities and implementation challenges specific to parallel hardware are explored. The results of this research offer social scientists better informed choices than the sequential EBM frameworks that currently exist. Matching the model to the correct supporting hardware will permit larger scale problems to be examined and expands the range of models that a social scientist can explore.",

The book is addressed to teachers, researchers, students practicing the social sciences.

          "This volume of original chapters written by experts in the field offers a snapshot of how historical built spaces, past cultural landscapes, and archaeological distributions are currently being explored through computational social science. It focuses on the continuing importance of spatial and spatio-temporal pattern recognition in the archaeological record, considers more wholly model-based approaches that fix ideas and build theory, and addresses those applications where situated human experience and perception are a core interest. Reflecting the changes in computational technology over the past decade, the authors bring in examples from historic and prehistoric sites in Europe, Asia, and the Americas to demonstrate the variety of applications available to the contemporary researcher.",
          "This paper presents a comparative perspective among traditional methods of qualitative and quantitative research and the potential of the new modeling and simulation paradigm for social science research, the different methods, and tools. We reviewed the criteria for the dynamic simulation of cellular automata and agents and outlined the concepts from artificial intelligence and artificial life, artificial societies and artificial culture, leading to a computational social science explanation. The study focuses on the Modeling and Agent-Based Simulation (ABMS, for the term in Spanish) as the quintessential device that allows understanding and explaning the emergence, evolution, and adaptation of social phenomena, rather than the typical prediction of other types of simulation. The ABMS methodology is positioned as a laboratory to modify the conditions of simulation of real phenomena, and allows constructing artificial societies where it is possible to perform experiments prevented by morals, ethics and/or costs in real life.",
          "Recent developments of computational methods supporting scientific research have led to the rise of a variety of computational science disciplines, such as computational physics, computational biology, computational chemistry, computational social science, and many more. Although simulation is now widely regarded as the third pillar of science, with epistemological status comparable to formal theorizing and experimentation, the insight that computational science is as interwoven with simulation as traditional science is with modeling, has not yet been sufficiently communicated. As a result, important insights from the modeling and simulation discipline are not known or are ignored by traditional scientists entering the computational branch of their discipline. This presentation contributes to closing this gap by giving examples of how modeling and simulated based research contributes to improve computational sciences, including having a look at the supporting philosophy of science perspectives.",
          "Computational models have an increasing impact in social and historical sciences. In this paper, I will focus on a specific type of modelling developed in computational social sciences, an agent-based model. My inquiry will aim to identify the sort of explanatory virtues that such a model could have. I will discuss the suggested possibility of causal explanations but also the recent proposal advanced by Grune-Yanoff that sees them as potential functional explanations. In the last part I shall make some suggestions on how to advance our inquiry. These will point to the need of a more consistent explanatory context drawing on the way social scientists make use of such models. The other will point to the need of considering a cognitive process that is closely related to the explanatory one - understanding.",
          "Using models to capture empirical insight and describe our current understandings has long been accepted as part of building scientific knowledge. Now, however, we use models for conducting simulation-based experiments. Understanding the epistemological constraints of such models is important because models are merely purposeful abstractions and simplifications of a perception of reality. Characterizing these explicitly helps us to comprehend, share, and reproduce the results of research; it also enables multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary collaboration. We observe that – like the social systems under study – simulation methodologies vary widely. This is good, not bad. By employing simulations from different perspectives, we can build a more complete understanding of social systems – applying both bottom-up and top-down approaches in doing so. Having both competing and complementary simulation compositions is fundamental in computational social science, but having these also contributes to the ontology and epistemology of social science.",
          "This chapter attempts to set the research agenda on emergence in the medium and long term and proposes a simulation experience approach (SEA) based on the mix of live-virtual and constructive (LVC) simulation. It demonstrates that the research in employing emergence in complex systems (CSs) engineering must be transdisciplinary. The chapter introduces the notion of multi-modeling and proposes it as an approach for studying induced emergence in computational social sciences. It then demonstrates how a combination of modeling and simulation (M&S), statistical, and exploratory analysis can be applied to detect the presence of a potentially emergent behavior. The chapter discusses the reasons for emergent failures and proposes a fuzzy passing extent approach. It further presents the grand challenges of emergence research that have to be addressed in the research agenda not only of academia, but in research efforts of industry and practitioners as well.",
          "This issue includes two articles with additional research examples from distinguished experts in social science and computer science. In the first article, \"Secondary Avatars and Semiautonomous Agents\" presents semiautonomous agent assistants that have been incorporated into recent MMOGs. In the second article, a group of people constructed combat, mentoring, and trust networks based on data from Sony's popular MMOG Everquest II. They also provide an excellent summary of their ongoing research in performance and learning, player churn analysis, and identifying undesirable behavior in MMOGs. The authors argue that the close collaboration between social scientists and computer scientists is creating an emerging area called \"computational social science,\" where computation is used as an integral mechanism in social science research.",
          "We propose a new research organization management paradigm to increase throughput of projects by allowing researchers to choose their own projects through self-organization. Our methods draw upon the field of Agent-Based computational social science where Artificial Life and simulated societies have been used to study complex systems including economies and financial markets. Modeling the researchers as individual agents, we simulate our new management structure against a more traditional organization where the researchers are broken into departments based on their skills and assigned projects by management. Our results, measuring the amount of time it takes a research organization to serve a given number of contracts, show promise in the less hierarchical approach.",
          "Computational social science plays an important role in emergency management from a quantitative perspective. Reconstructing an individual-based social computing environment is crucial for both accurate computational experiments and determining optimal decisions. Here, the authors propose a formalization method to define basic componential models in the artificial society and the inner logic in these models. A detailed generation process is presented, and multisource statistical data, social interactive behavior, and multilayer social networks are integrated together. As an evaluation of the proposed framework, a virtual city of Beijing is reconstructed. Each citizen is endowed with demographic attributes, including age, gender, social role, correlated geographic locations, and multiple social relations. The generated synthetic population is statistically equivalent to the real population. Transmission experiments of influenza are performed in the reconstructed computational environment, and individual daily interacting behavior is tracked and analyzed. The results indicate that the framework can provide an effective methodology to reconstruct the computing environment in high resolution by using low-resolution statistical data, leading to better prediction and management of emergencies.",
          "This chapter provides a critical survey of emergence definitions both from a conceptual and formal standpoint. The notions of downward/backward causation and weak/strong emergence are specially discussed for application to complex social system with cognitive agents. Particular attention is devoted to the formal definitions introduced by Müller (2004) and Bonabeau and Dessalles (1997), which are operative in multi-agent frameworks and make sense from both cognitive and social point of view. A diagrammatic 4-Quadrant approach allows us to understand complex phenomena along both interior/exterior and individual/collective dimensions.",
          "Advancement in computational social science requires the expertise of social, computational, and data scientists. The field thrives due to the diversity of backgrounds and skills that these researchers bring from their native disciplines. Researchers also bring diversity in terminology that creates challenges in maintaining the effective communication necessary to design and execute complex research projects. We posit that a tool is needed to support communication and coordination across the members of research teams in computational social science. We propose a version of that tool: the Agent-Based Model Canvas. The Canvas is composed of nine basic building blocks that provide a framework for social theory design, testing, improvement, codification, and discussion in a truly interdisciplinary environment. The purpose of the Canvas is to assist theory discovery and refinement in an iterative fashion. The first version of the Canvas will be a starting point to list untested hypotheses and rough ideas about the elements of the model. As this iterative development process continues, the hypotheses are revised based on data analysis and emerging insights. This process progressively leads to refined descriptions that are machine executable, testable hypotheses, and finally, fully tested theories.",

From this observatory, we deploy a set of arguments defending the need for social simulation as one of the best chances we have to make a much needed step forward in the scientific endeavor of the twenty first century: understanding society. Building on these arguments, we point out several reasons that caused social simulation to fall several measures short of the big challenge, discussing some famous examples from the literature. We then introduce the concept of crowdsourcing, trying to elaborate on how it could reshape this methodology for computational social science.",
          "Abstract. This article reviews computational social science methods and their relation to conventional methodology and statistics. Computational social science has three important features. Firstly, it often involves big data; data sets so large that conventional database and analysis techniques cannot handle them with ease. Secondly, dealing with these big data sets has given rise to analysis techniques that are specially developed for big data. Given the size of the data, resampling and cross-validation approaches become feasible that allow both data-driven exploration and checks on overfitting the data. A third important feature is simulation, especially agent-based simulation. Here size also matters. Agent-based simulation is well known in social science, but modern computer equipment and software allows simulations of unprecedented scale. Many of these techniques, especially the resampling and cross-validation approaches, are potentially very useful for social scientists. Given the relatively small size of social science “big data” is useful to explore how well these techniques perform with smaller data sets. Social science methodology can contribute to this field by exploring if well-known methodological distinctions between external validity, internal validity, and construct validity can help clear up discussions on data quality (veracity) in computational social science.",
          "Abstract The social sciences and humanities are fragmented into specialized areas, each with their own parlance and procedures. This hinders information sharing and the growth of a coherent body of knowledge. Modeling and simulation can be the scientific lingua franca, or shared technical language, that can unite, integrate, and relate relevant parts of these diverse disciplines. Models are well established in the scientific community as mediators, contributors, and enablers of scientific knowledge. We propose a potentially revolutionary linkage between social sciences, humanities and computer simulation, forging what we call “human simulation.” We explore three facets of human simulation, namely: (1) the simulation of humans, (2) the design of simulations for human use, and (3) simulations that include humans as well as simulated agents among the actors. We describe the potential of human simulation using several illuminating examples. We also discuss computational, epistemological, and hermeneutical challenges constraining the use of human simulation.",
          "BharatSim is an open-source agent-based modelling framework for the Indian population. It can simulate populations at multiple scales, from small communities to states. BharatSim uses a synthetic population created by applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to survey data from multiple sources, including the Census of India, the India Human Development Survey, the National Sample Survey, and the Gridded Population of the World. This synthetic population defines individual agents with multiple attributes, among them age, gender, home and work locations, pre-existing health conditions, and socio-economic and employment status. BharatSim’s domain-specific language provides a framework for the simulation of diverse models. Its computational core, coded in Scala , supports simulations of a large number of individual agents, up to 50 million. Here, we describe the design and implementation of BharatSim, using it to address three questions motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic in India: (i) When can schools be safely reopened given specified levels of hybrid immunity?, (ii) How do new variants alter disease dynamics in the background of prior infections and vaccinations? and (iii) How can the effects of varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) be quantified for a model Indian city? Through its India-specific synthetic population, BharatSim allows disease modellers to address questions unique to this country. It should also find use in the computational social sciences, potentially providing new insights into emergent patterns in social behaviour.",
          "This chapter presents a model for influencing and shaping that employs computational red teaming. The model is demonstrated and validated computationally using a simulation environment where social influencing and shaping are applied to an artificial society. Network topology for situation awareness and a trust factor on perceived information were added to the classic Boids model to enable the investigation of influence and shaping. The chapter builds on the difference between influence and shaping. First, this distinction is important because it implies that influencing is a sufficient condition for shaping. Second, it is important in computational social sciences to facilitate the creation of models that are not ambiguous about the socio-psychological phenomena under investigation. Third, the distinction is important because it clarifies that influencing and shaping work on different time scales – influencing is effective in the short term, whereas shaping is more effective in the long term.",
          "SISTER, a Symbolic Interactionist Simulation of Trade and Emergent Roles, captures the fundamental social process by which macro level roles emerge from micro level symbolic interaction. SISTER may be used for the computational social science objective of modeling social coordination in human societies, or for the artificial intelligence objective of coordinating coevolving agents in artificial societies. The knowledge in a SISTER society is held culturally, suspended in the mutual expectations agents have of each other based on signs (tags) that they read and display. In this study, this knowledge includes how to create complex goods. The knowledge of coordinating their creation arises endogenously. A symbol system emerges to denote these tasks. In terms of information theory, the degree of mutual information between the agent's signs (tags) and their behavior increases over time. In SISTER societies, mutual information can grow endogenously and be maintained robustly, even when agents die and are replaced, or are spread out over space. _x000D_\nThe SISTER society of this study is an economic simulation, in which agents have the choice of growing all the goods they need by themselves, or concentrating their efforts in making more of fewer goods and trading them for other goods. They induce the sign of an agent to trade with, while at the same time, they induce a sign to display. The signs come to mean sets of behaviors, or roles, through this double induction. A system of roles emerges, holding the knowledge of social coordination needed to distribute tasks amongst the agents. This knowledge is maintained despite the stresses of the death and dislocation of individual agents. _x000D_\nThis dissertation contributes to artificial intelligence by demonstrating how agents may divide their labor in a task endogenously. It shows how a complex endogenous communication system can develop to coordinate a complex division of tasking. It also shows that with a SISTER algorithm in which agents die, coevolving systems can avoid convergence and continue to grow in knowledge. With the SISTER algorithm, robot societies can robustly continue to maintain their symbols and roles despite death and distance.",
          "The interest of physicists in economic and social questions is not new: during the last decades, we have witnessed the emergence of what is formally called nowadays sociophysics and econophysics that can be grouped into the common term 'Interdisciplinary Physics' along with biophysics, medical physics, agrophysics, etc. With tools borrowed from statistical physics and complexity science, among others, these areas of study have already made important contributions to our understanding of how humans organize and interact in our modern society. Large scale data analyses, agent-based modeling and numerical simulations, and finally mathematical modeling, have led to the discovery of new (universal) patterns and their quantitative description in socio-economic systems. At the turn of the century, however, it was clear that huge challenges -and new opportunities- lied ahead: the digital communication technologies, and their associated data deluge, began to nurture those models with empirical significance. Only a decade later, the advent of the Web 2.0, the Internet of Things and a general adoption of mobile technologies have convinced researchers that theories can be mapped to real scenarios and put into empirical test, closing in this way the experiment-theory cycle in the best tradition of physics. We are nowadays at a crossroads, at which different approaches converge. We name such crossroads computational social science (CSS) : a new discipline that can offer abstracted (simplified, idealized) models and methods (mainly from statistical physics), large storage, algorithms and computational power (computer and data science), and a set of social hypotheses together with a conceptual framework for the results to be interpreted (Social Science). Despite its youth, the field is developing rapidly in terms of contents (articles, books, etc.), but also institutionally -either under the form of labs, institutes, and academic programs; or as consolidated events and scientific gatherings. This 'work-in-progress' spirit is reflected as well in this volume: the call was launched in late 2014 and 10 articles were eventually accepted and published, including reviews -a look behind-, one methods paper, and six original contributions -a look ahead- introducing a broad range of research, from models with a strong analytical flavor to data-driven problems.",
          "Readers will find results of recent research on computational social science and social simulation economics, management, sociology,and history written by leading experts in the field. SOCIAL SIMULATION (former ESSA) conferences constitute annual events which serve as an international platform for the exchange of ideas and discussion of cutting edge research in the field of social simulations, both from the theoretical as well as applied perspective, and the 2014 edition benefits from the cross-fertilization of three different research communities into one single event. The volume consists of 122 articles, corresponding to most of the contributions to the conferences, in three different formats: short abstracts (presentation of work-in-progress research), posters (presentation of models and results), and full papers (presentation of social simulation research including results and discussion). The compilation is completed with indexing lists to help finding articles by title, author and thematic content. We are convinced that this book will serve interested readers as a useful compendium which presents in a nutshell the most recent advances at the frontiers of computational social sciences and social simulation research",
          "In the first part of the paper, the field of agent-based modeling (ABM) is discussed focusing on the role of generative theories, aiming at explaining phenomena by growing them. After a brief analysis of the major strengths of the field some crucial weaknesses are analyzed. In particular, the generative power of ABM is found to have been underexploited, as the pressure for simple recipes has prevailed and shadowed the application of rich cognitive models. In the second part of the paper, the renewal of interest for Computational Social Science (CSS) is focused upon, and several of its variants, such as deductive, generative, and complex CSS, are identified and described. In the concluding remarks, an interdisciplinary variant, which takes after ABM, reconciling it with the quantitative one, is proposed as a fundamental requirement for a new program of the CSS.",
          "International networks, although highly efficient, may produce surprising threshold effects that shift costs to geographically distant locations. International utility, transportation, and information networks facilitate the efficient flow of information, energy, goods and people. These networks exhibit a scale-free network structure with a few large “hubs”. Yet their efficiency belies their lack of robustness. Because such networks transcend national boundaries, furthermore, disruptions to the network in one geographic region may have profound economic and national security costs for countries in another region. To illustrate how complex networks may transmit costs among countries, this paper builds an agent-based model (ABM) of the international air transportation system. The ABM employs a genetic algorithm to identify “small” disruptions that produce cascading network failures. The study makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how some complex networks evolve into network structures that trade off robustness for efficiency. Second, it illustrates how researchers can combine agent-based modeling, evolutionary computation, and network analysis to simulate differing failure modes for global networks. This convergence of simulation methodologies characterizes the emerging field of computational social science.",

          "Agent-based modeling (ABM) has transformed social science research by allowing researchers to replicate or generate the emergence of empirically complex social phenomena from a set of relatively simple agent-based rules at the micro-level. Swarm, RePast, Ascape, and others currently provide simulation environments for ABM social science research. After Swarm!—!arguably the first widely used ABM simulator employed in the social sciences!—!subsequent simulators have sought to enhance available simulation tools and computational capabilities by providing additional functionalities and formal modeling facilities. Here we present MASON (Multi-Agent Simulator Of Neighborhoods), following in a similar tradition that seeks to enhance the power and diversity of the available scientific toolkit in computational social science. MASON is intended to provide a core of facilities useful not only to social science but to other agent-based modeling fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics. We believe this can foster useful “cross-pollination” between such diverse disciplines, and further that MASON's additional facilities will become increasing important as social complexity simulation matures and grows into new approaches. We illustrate the new MASON simulation library with a replication of HeatBugs and a demonstration of MASON applied to two challenging case studies: ant-like foragers and micro-aerial agents. Other applications are also being developed. The HeatBugs replication and the two new applications provide an idea of MASON’s potential for computational social science and artificial societies.",
          "We advocate the development of a discipline of interacting with and extracting information from models, both mathematical (e.g. game-theoretic ones) and computational (e.g. agent-based models). We outline some directions for the development of a such a discipline: - the development of logical frameworks for the systematic formal specification of stylized facts and social mechanisms in (mathematical and computational) social science. Such frameworks would bring to attention new issues, such as phase transitions, i.e. dramatical changes in the validity of the stylized facts beyond some critical values in parameter space. We argue that such statements are useful for those logical frameworks describing properties of ABM. - the adaptation of tools from the theory of reactive systems (such as bisimulation) to obtain practically relevant notions of two systems \"having the same behavior\". - the systematic development of an adversarial theory of model perturbations, that investigates the robustness of conclusions derived from models of social behavior to variations in several features of the social dynamics. These may include: activation order, the underlying social network, individual agent behavior.",
          "Behavioral sciences are focused on the observation of individuals' behavior in order to explain it. In our approach, observation and explanation of behavior play two different but complementary roles. In behavioral computational social science, in fact, observation of behavior is a necessary component of modeling that allows discovering and testing complex causal mechanisms explaining social phenomena. The explanation of behavior is not usually required for modeling, and it does not directly explain social phenomena, but it provides robustness to modeling, to the interpretation of results, and in summary to the validity of explanatory social mechanisms. The chapter firstly introduces concepts and references to the vast literature and methodology of behavioral sciences. Then, it discusses the most diffused methods to observe behavior, and it briefly introduces the tools that allow implementing those methods. The chapter concludes discussing the main critical issues that are commonly found when observing behavior (induced responses, external validity, replicability).",
          "With the growth of big data, there has been a rush to develop models in the social sciences that extract patterns of behavior from data without a corresponding theory to explain those behaviors. While it is useful to identify and examine these patterns, the use of these regularities for predictions and intervention is dangerous without theory. In this chapter, I explore this danger and develop guidelines for avoiding the pitfalls of theoryless big data modeling. I also examine two methods (parameter optimization and rule induction) of using agent-based modeling to create theory-interpreted knowledge about large data sets. I also discuss future extensions that make this a potentially revolutionary approach to next-generation computational social science.",
          "The paper presents the computer simulation of social phenomena as a promising method to investigate the links tying human cognition, society and law. The focus is on agent-based modeling, a research methodology that is offering new ways to explore how the interaction between individuals (and the cognitive mechanisms governing their decisions) leads to the emergence and evolution of complex, macro-level social constructs from opinion dynamics to social norms. After a brief introduction to the theoretical and methodological framework underlying the proposal - a landscape shaped by cognitive sciences, complexity theory and computational social science - the paper delves into the basic features of agent-based simulations. It then explores the applications of this methodology in the study of legally relevant phenomena, like social norms emergence or the effects of sanctions. The review serves as an opportunity to reflect not only on the scientific and methodological frontiers of legal sociology but also on the perspectives of empirical evolution of legal science.",
          "In this chapter, the authors consider the idea of technological lock-ins to demonstrate the value of focusing on the idea of emergence as a primary concept in computational social sciences. The authors model the emergence of scaling in communication networks to show how simple individual rules can lead to technology adoption patterns that are robust to starting communication network structures. One application of the complexity theory and exploration of emergence is in information economies where authors can theorize on the mechanisms that drive adoption of some technologies over others. Epstein argues that the classical notions of emergence are not the same as what is described in agent-based modeling and simulation contexts. Wilson proposed a narrow definition in an attempt to quantify \"weak emergence\", while Gilbert and Cederman each offer a taxonomy of \"emergence\" in relation to modeling social behavior and norms.",
          "In sociology, interest in modelling has not yet become widespread. However, the methodology has been gaining increased attention in parallel with its growing popularity in economics and other social sciences, notably psychology and political science, and the growing volume of social data being measured and collected. In this paper, we present representative computational methodologies from both data-driven (such as “black box”) and rule-based (such as “per analogy”) approaches. We show how to build simple models, and discuss both the greatest successes and the major limitations of modelling societies. We claim that the end goal of computational tools in sociology is providing meaningful analyses and calculations in order to allow making causal statements in sociological explanation and support decisions of great importance for society.",
          "Behavioral experiments are rarely used as an empirical strategy in computational social science, where empirical studies typically focus on analyzing large-scale digital trace data. We argue that behavioral experiments have a role in computational social science, in particular in combination with agent-based modeling – a key theoretical strategy in computational social science. We highlight three ways in which behavioral experiments can contribute to theory building in computational social science: by testing macro-level predictions from agent-based models, by evaluating behavioral assumptions on which these models are based, and by calibrating agent-based models. We illustrate these points through three examples from our work concerned with the emergence of conventions.",
          "The classical theory of computation does not represent an adequate model of reality for simulation in the social sciences. The aim of this paper is to construct a methodological perspective that is able to conciliate the formal and empirical logic of program verification in computer science, with the interpretative and multiparadigmatic logic of the social sciences. We attempt to evaluate whether social simulation implies an additional perspective about the way one can understand the concepts of program and computation. We demonstrate that the logic of social simulation implies at least two distinct types of program verifications that reflect an epistemological distinction in the kind of knowledge one can have about programs. Computer programs seem to possess a causal capability (Fetzer, 1999) and an intentional capability that scientific theories seem not to possess. This distinction is associated with two types of program verification, which we call empirical and intentional verification. We demonstrate, by this means, that computational phenomena are also intentional phenomena, and that such is particularly manifest in agent-based social simulation. Ascertaining the credibility of results in social simulation requires a focus on the identification of a new category of knowledge we can have about computer programs. This knowledge should be considered an outcome of an experimental exercise, albeit not empirical, acquired within a context of limited consensus. The perspective of intentional computation seems to be the only one possible to reflect the multiparadigmatic character of social science in terms of agent-based computational social science. We contribute, additionally, to the clarification of several questions that are found in the methodological perspectives of the discipline, such as the computational nature, the logic of program scalability, and the multiparadigmatic character of agent-based simulation in the social sciences.",
          "Computational social science involves the use of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) to study complex social systems. ABMS consists of a set of agents and a framework for simulating their decisions and interactions. ABMS is related to a variety of other simulation techniques, including discrete event simulation and distributed artificial intelligence or multi-agent systems. In practice, each agent has only partial knowledge of other agents and each agent makes its own decisions based on the partial knowledge about other agents in the system. For purposes of this paper, a multi-agent system will be implemented as a simulation framework in JADE development platform (JAVA programming language). The motivation was to use the agent-based simulation of the Tobin tax introduction together with the risk analysis and to investigate their impact on the stability of financial market. The hypothesis was that Tobin tax introduction will stabilize the financial market. The results obtained show that in the case of risk involvement into the system the hypothesis can be fulfilled only partially.",
          "Agent-based simulation has become one of the promising gears for computational social sciences including business management strategy studies. This paper describes an agent-based simulation model for analyzing corporate behaviors of competing firms. The simulator employs evolutionary computation to evolve the characteristics of the firms. This paper also addresses a novel technology of agent-based modeling with genetic algorithms. Our method is characterized by (1) decision making agents or competing companies with strategic parameters to be optimized; (2) a multiobjective optimisation framework to evolve the artificial simulated society; (3) grounding the simulation conditions with marketing survey data in the real world, and (4) validating the strategic parameters of the agents after simulation via statistical analysis of the individual genes. The proposed method enables us to investigate the strategic measures or balanced scoreboards of competing companies from the agents' actions in the simulator.",

These issues are computational epistemology, research methodology, and software technology. These innovations augment Agent Based Modeling to create an effective new tool base to help better understand complex social systems.",
          "I'd like to welcome you to the Agent 2004 conference. As most of you are aware, this conference is the fifth in a series of meetings that began in 1999. A conference followed the next year in 2000. The 2001 conference was skipped because of some conflicts with other conferences, and the conferences have proceeded annually since then. We have the proceedings of the previous conferences available here on CDs. One CD has the proceedings from 1999, 2000, and 2002; the other contains last year's proceedings. The purpose of these conferences is to advance the state of the computational social sciences and to integrate the social sciences with the decision sciences and something that is traditionally known as the management sciences. Those of you in the operations/research area are familiar with the traditional school of modeling simulation that emerged from that scientific area. This conference will bring together a different group of people to talk about the topic of agent-based theories and simulations. This fifth agent conference is one of a group of conferences held annually around the country. Most of you are probably aware of the CASOS Conference held at Carnegie Mellon University, usually in July. UCLA holds themore » Arrowhead Conference, generally around May. The University of Michigan is now holding a conference as well. Of course everyone is aware of SwarmFest, which has been held annually for about a decade. The Swarm seems to 'swarm' in different locations each year. As you're well aware, this conference is organized into a three-day program. This is the first time we've used three days for the full conference setting. Last year, we held simultaneous sessions, and that didn't work well for most of those who attended. We had complaints from people who missed sessions and papers because of scheduling, so we decided to extend this year's conference by one day. As a result, we now have a program designed to present the papers in a serial sequence rather than in a parallel manner. Today, we'll focus on toolkits. Tomorrow we'll look at computational social theory, and Saturday is application day. We'll talk about how we're taking some of the theories and toolkits to look at real-world problems in order to understand how our very complex world works and maybe even to predict how it might work in the future. In addition to the content of the papers themselves, one of the more important things about this conference is the discussion that is inspired by these papers. I invite you to ask penetrating questions, offer insightful comments, share your experiences with toolkits or your ideas on theories, and help to create an atmosphere that will help this field move along and grow. It's a fairly new science--it is just emerging--but it seems to have been gaining momentum in the last couple of years. This is a conference to get your energy going and perhaps foster your creativity. With that, I welcome you to Agent 2004; have a great time at the conference.« less",

          "Computational social science has witnessed a shift from pure theoretical to empirical agent-based models (ABMs) grounded in data-driven correlations between behavioral factors defining agents’ decisions. There is a strong urge to go beyond theoretical ABMs with behavioral theories setting stylized rules that guide agents’ actions, especially when it concerns policy-related simulations. However, it remains unclear to what extent theory-driven ABMs mislead, if at all, a choice of a policy when compared to the outcomes of models with empirical micro-foundations. This is especially relevant for pro-environmental policies that increasingly rely on quantifying cumulative effects of individual behavioral changes, where ABMs are so helpful. We propose a comparison framework to address this methodological dilemma, which quantitatively explores the gap in predictions between theory-and data-driven ABMs. Inspired by the existing theory-driven model, ORVin-T, which studies the individual choice between organic and conventional products, we design a survey to collect data on individual preferences and purchasing decisions. We then use this extensive empirical microdata to build an empirical twin, ORVin-E, replacing the theoretical assumptions and secondary aggregated data used to parametrize agents’ decision strategies with our empirical survey data. We compare the models in terms of key outputs, perform sensitivity analysis, and explore three policy scenarios. We observe that the theory-driven model predicts the shifts to organic consumption as accurately as the ABM with empirical micro-foundations at both aggregated and individual scales. There are slight differences (±5%) between the estimations of the two models with regard to different behavioral change scenarios: increasing conventional tax, launching organic social-informational campaigns, and their combination. Our findings highlight the goodness of fit and usefulness of theoretical modeling efforts, at least in the case of incremental behavioral change. It sheds light on the conditions when theory-driven and data-driven models are aligned and on the value of empirical data for studying systemic changes.",
          "The capability of modeling individuals' behavior is at the core of the integration of the behavioral and the computational social science approaches. Modeling behavior can be done following two rather different methodological approaches. The first focuses on behavior only, it leaves the burden of explanation of behavior outside the model and it is the focus of this chapter. Behavioral agents are, in fact, the models of agents where the explanation of behavior is left outside of the model. They are empirically grounded and they are not black boxes, and thus the causal relationships leading to agents' decisions must be clear. The need for empirical salience in behavioral agents requires paying a specific attention in data collection, which is the first issue addressed by this chapter. Then the chapter continues with a detailed discussion of the calibration and classification of behavioral agents. The chapter ends by discussing the critical issues that are usually faced in developing behavioral agents (validation, modeling of uncertainty).",

          "With its focus on entities interacting, agent-based modeling is the quintessential methodology for understanding emergent phenomena and the processes of emerging in complex systems. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational social science “that enables a researcher to create, analyze, and experiment with models composed of agents that interact within an environment” (Gilbert, 2008). ABM has contributed to theory creation and development in organizational and social sciences (Axelrod, 1997; Smith & Conrey, 2007), as well as uniquely representing emergent and dynamic processes and systems not captured in traditional correlation models (Coen, 2009).Â To this end, ABM’s efficacy with both predictive modeling of team and intergroup dynamics in organizations, as well as ABM’s ability to represent emergent and dynamic processes within teams, has been demonstrated by researchers and by several of the presenters of this symposium (Harrison, Lin, Carroll & Carley, 2007).Â Specifically, ABM’s ability to model and demonstrate the complexity of collaborative/cooperative processes (Axelrod, 1997; Coen, 2006), decision-making processes (Millhiser, Coen, & Solow, 2011), knowledge sharing (Mohammed & Dumville, 2001), and influence (Mas, Flache, Takacs & Jehn, 2013) of heterogeneous individuals within teams/groups and among groups has important predictive value for individual, group and organizational behavior and performance.

          "The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.",
          "Computational Social Science is one of the newest and most promising research lines trying to understand human behaviour. Within this context, Agent-Based Modelling is a tool increasingly being used, as it allows 1) to explicit human behaviour at an individual scale, and 2) to detect emergent properties of the system as a whole. An important characteristic of ABM is that social scientists seem more comfortable with this than with other tools (like classical equation based solutions), as ABM provides a friendly framework to integrate social science knowledge. Despite the potential advantages of ABM, there is an ongoing discussion about the way these models should be used. The standard approach for ABM is the design of abstract, simple models with a low number of parameters and agents. Nevertheless, the access to increasing numbers of datasets and computing facilities has opened the door to highly complex and realistic models. This presentation explores the problems and challenges that archaeological simulation modellers need to face if they are interested on exploiting the power of High-Performance Computing (HPC). Complex social scenarios require simulations with advanced artificial intelligence and large numbers of agents. HPCs seem the solution to tackle this added complexity, but little work has been done in order to understand real consequences of using ABM in HPC environments. These systems split a problem in different modules, each of them being executed on a computer node that should communicate with the other ones as little as possible. This idea is exactly opposite to ABM, where agents affect each other, share information, and modify the environment, so the ratio of communication between them is high. Moreover, the analysis of simulation results is difficult, because scientists should be able to explore the model, both in terms of individual traits (adaptation, co-evolution) and emergent global processes (collectives, spatial patterns) We present Pandora as a possible solution to these problems. It is a library specially designed to deal with distributed, fully scalable archaeology-related ABM. This C++/MPI library manages the distribution of executions in a transparent way in any system. Parallelization is automatically organized from spatial coordinates, and each computer node only needs to communicate with its neighbours. This tool is complemented by Cassandra, an application designed to analyse simulation results combining statistics, GIS and visualization. Unfortunately there is no universal answer to the challenge of distributing ABM, and this paper shows how the choice of solutions should basically depend on the relation between time and space scales. We will discuss the issues generated from the use of Pandora in different case studies, developed between archaeologists, anthropologists and computer scientists. These experiences have been useful to detect some of the problems that will be common in large-scale ABM like parallelization of advanced agents, GIS integration, stochasticity of the system and potential bottlenecks. Conclusions describes how these issues can be fixed or avoided, in order to advance towards a generalised use of HPC in archaeological simulations.",

          "Abstract Social simulation—an emerging field of computational social science—has progressed from simple toy models to increasingly realistic models of complex social systems, such as agent- based models where heterogeneous agents interact with changing natural or artificial environments. These larger, multidisciplinary projects require a scientific research methodology distinct from, say, simpler social simulations with more limited scope, intentionally minimal complexity, and typically under a single investigator. This paper proposes a methodology for complex social simulations—particularly inter- and multi-disciplinary socio-natural systems with multi-level architecture—based on a succession of models akin to but distinct from the late Imre Lakatos' notion of a 'research programme'. The proposed methodology is illustrated through examples from the Mason-Smithsonian project on agent-based models of the rise and fall of polities in Inner Asia. While the proposed methodology requires further development, so far it has proven valuable for advancing the scientific objectives of the project and avoiding some pitfalls.",
          "Social simulation using agent‐based models (computational social science) is an active area of research with amongst others inquiries into the role and use of norms as social coordination mechanisms. The focus has been on inter‐agent mechanisms through which individuals are influenced by social norms, resulting in dynamics of norms such as emergence and diffusion. What is lacking is an integration of models of collectiveness such as we‐intentionality to transcend the atomistic models such as rational choice, game theory, and social choice theory. Starting from an integrated model comprising a collection of psychological theories (the Consumat model) we propose extensions to this model to include a level of abstraction above the intereagent model namely the level of collectivity in which agents’individualistic decision‐making modes are replaced by models of the collective of which the agents are part.",

          "Abstract BharatSim is an open-source agent-based modelling framework for the Indian population. It can simulate populations at multiple scales, from small communities to states. BharatSim uses a synthetic population created by applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to survey data from multiple sources, including the Census of India, the India Human Development Survey, the National Sample Survey, and the Gridded Population of the World. This synthetic population defines individual agents with multiple attributes, among them age, gender, home and work locations, pre-existing health conditions, and socio-economic and employment status. BharatSim’s domain-specific language provides a framework for the simulation of diverse models. Its computational core, coded in Scala , supports simulations of a large number of individual agents, up to 50 million. Here, we describe the design and implementation of BharatSim, using it to address three questions motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic in India: (i) When can schools be safely reopened given specified levels of hybrid immunity?, (ii) How do new variants alter disease dynamics in the background of prior infections and vaccinations? and (iii) How can the effects of varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) be quantified for a model Indian city? Through its India-specific synthetic population, BharatSim allows disease modellers to address questions unique to this country. It should also find use in the computational social sciences, potentially providing new insights into emergent patterns in social behaviour. Author summary Agent-based simulations provide granular ways of describing the dynamics of each individual in a population. Such models are especially useful in describing the spread of an infectious disease, since they can be used to incorporate individual-level heterogeneity in behaviour and susceptibilities, as well as spatio-temporal information. BharatSim is such an agent-based modelling framework for India. It can simulate populations at multiple scales, from a few hundreds to several millions. It creates and uses a predefined synthetic population for India, assimilating it into a simulation framework. The synthetic population defines individuals with multiple attributes, among them age, sex, home, and work locations. We demonstrate the use of BharatSim in three contexts related to the COVID-19 pandemic in India.",
          "The problem of consumer purchase behaviour has been concerned by many researchers.The paper presents an agent-based model of consumer purchased behaviour.The main of agentbased modelling is the modifier motivation function that considered price of commodities, quality of commodities, and website quality.Moreover, the study used Repast Simphony toolkit to simulate the modifier motivation function.The method of agent-based simulation gave a dynamic expression in consumer purchased behaviour. IntroductionAgent-based modelling is a form of computational social science, which is a new analytical and computational method [1-3].Agent-based modelling has offered an interesting method to solve some complex issues in many fields of study [4][5].Jin Chun et al. [6] introduced an agent-based modelling and simulation method to build the relationship between customer behaviour and personalized recommendation.Zhao Aiwu et al. [7] described green purchase behaviour of bounded rational consumers based on computational experiments.Jin Chun et al. [8] proposed an agentbased modelling and simulation method on the consumer's purchasing behaviours under the website promotions.Schenk et al. [9] presented the particulars of an agent-based micro model for grocery shopping, based on an individual population and store data gathered in northern Sweden.Roozmand et al. [10] proposed an agent-based conceptual and computational model of consumer decisionmaking based on culture, personality and human needs.Du Jianguo et al. [11] established an agentbased computational experiments model for evolution of enterprise's productive behaviour of green products．With the development of e-commerce, consumer purchase behaviour is concerned by many scholars.In this paper, consumer purchase behaviour is online shopping of consumer behaviour.In general, consumer purchased behaviour includes five stages: need recognition, information search, evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and post-purchase behaviour [12].Need recognition is also called problem identification, which is the first step in consumer purchased behaviour.It occurs when a consumer discovers an unmet need that must be fulfilled.Information search is a consumer searches for internal or external information.Evaluation of alternatives is a stage, in which consumers compare the brands and products that are in their evoked set.Purchase decision is a stage, where the purchase takes place.Post-purchase behaviour is when the customer assesses whether he is satisfied or dissatisfied with a purchase.Consumer purchase behaviour includes research in the field of personality, psychology, sociology, marketing, which is affected some factors, such as price of commodity, quality of commodity, advertisement and follower tendency et al. [13].Recently, researchers have confirmed that website quality influence online shopping of the consumer behaviour [14][15][16].Yang et al. [17] presented the differences between multinational and domestic e-commerce companies in the influence of website quality on online purchase intention.Li Junjun and Sun Jianjun [18] proposed the user technology adoption model and hypotheses by combining the e-commerce website quality and perception factors.Yang Zhaojun and Song Xueting [19] studied the impacts of different dimensions of website quality and website customer service on",
          "Abstract versus Descriptive . Models can vary in the degree to which they attempt to incorporate the detail of particular targets. An example of a model which aims to be a detailed representation of a specific location and the developments there is the work by Dean et al. (1999) on the Long House Valley, in northern Arizona near Monument Valley. The model covers a time from about A.D. 400 to 1400 and consists of agent households that inhabit a digitized version of the Long House Valley landscape. Agents have rules for determining their agricultural practices and residential locations, as well as for reproduction and mortality. Each run of the model generates a unique history of population, agricultural output, and settlement patterns which can be compared with archaeological evidence from the Valley. In contrast, a series of papers (Conte and Castelfranchi 1995, Castelfranchi, Conte and Paolucci 1998, Saam and Harrer 1999, Staller and Petta 2001, Flenthe, Polani and Uthman 2001, Hales 2002, Younger 2004) has explored the relationship between norms and social inequality using a very simple ‘game’ in which agents controlled by ‘norms’ (i.e. behavioural rules) search a regular grid for ‘food’, which they consume to maintain their energy level or ‘strength’. These authors carried out experiments to study the mean and variance of the distribution of strength under various normative arrangements. Two examples are ‘blind aggression’, when agents attack other agents to grab their food, regardless of whether the attacked agent is stronger than they are, and ‘finders-keeper’, when agents respect ‘property rights’ and do not attack other",
          "Big data-driven machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) is not all computational social sciences (CSS) have. Agent-based modeling (ABM) or multi-agent system (MAS) is another fundamentally different but equally useful approach in CSS. In fact, the two approaches start from very different orientations and their differences have deeper root in ontology. ML/AI aims to imitate and then surpass human capacities, from sensing to perceiving, reasoning, calculating, and acting. In contrast, ABM seeks to simulate how social outcomes emerge from the complex interactions of agents&amp;rsquo; actions within a specific environment. Yet, precisely because these two technologies are different, they can be complementary to each other. There is a bright future for integrating ABM with ML/AI for tackling real world challenges.",
          "This paper discusses the central problems with creating valid computational social science simulations, and then suggests answers to these problems that involve co-evolution, autonomy, interpretation, and data processing under uncertainty. We also present the use of these techniques in the Nexus cognitive agent simulation, used at the US Department of Defense (DoD) in multiple major analyses of Irregular Warfare. We introduce the technique of data absorption, which leverages co-evolutionary pressure to reproduce the same dynamic structures that caused observable real word data in the simulation through the motivations of the agents. This technique gives a causal explanation for the data, and sets the stage for testing the effects of interventions never seen by the system on the system. By mimicking the state of equilibrium reached by the natural system, data absorption closes the gap between theory-centric simulations and data centric simulations."

          "The community structure in fully signed networks that considers both node attributes and edge signs is important in computational social science; however, its physical description still requires further exploration, and the corresponding measurement remains lacking. In this paper, we present a generalized framework of community structure in fully signed networks, based on which a variant of modularity is designed. An optimization algorithm that maximizes modularity to detect potential communities is also proposed. Experiments show that the proposed method can efficiently optimize the objective function and perform effective community detection.",
          "Uncertainty about models and data is ubiquitous in the computational social sciences, and it creates a need for robust social network algorithms, which can simultaneously provide guarantees across a spectrum of models and parameter settings. We begin an investigation into this broad domain by studying robust algorithms for the Influence Maximization problem, in which the goal is to identify a set of k nodes in a social network whose joint influence on the network is maximized. We define a Robust Influence Maximization framework wherein an algorithm is presented with a set of influence functions, typically derived from different influence models or different parameter settings for the same model. The different parameter settings could be derived from observed cascades on different topics, under different conditions, or at different times. The algorithm's goal is to identify a set of k nodes who are simultaneously influential for all influence functions, compared to the (function-specific) optimum solutions. We show strong approximation hardness results for this problem unless the algorithm gets to select at least a logarithmic factor more seeds than the optimum solution. However, when enough extra seeds may be selected, we show that techniques of Krause et al. can be used to approximate the optimum robust influence to within a factor of 1 - 1/e. We evaluate this bicriteria approximation algorithm against natural heuristics on several real-world data sets. Our experiments indicate that the worst-case hardness does not necessarily translate into bad performance on real-world data sets; all algorithms perform fairly well.",
          "Online social networks are growing and becoming denser.The social connections of a given person may have very high variability: from close friends and relatives to acquaintances to people who hardly know. Inferring the strength of social ties is an important ingredient for modeling the interaction of users in a network and understanding their behavior. Furthermore, the problem has applications in computational social science, viral marketing, and people recommendation. In this paper we study the problem of inferring the strength of social ties in a given network. Our work is motivated by a recent approach by Sintos et. al [24], which leverages the Strong Triadic Closure} STC principle, a hypothesis rooted in social psychology. To guide our inference process, in addition to the network structure, we also consider as input a collection of tight communities. Those are sets of vertices that we expect to be connected via strong ties. Such communities appear in different situations, e.g., when being part of a community implies a strong connection to one of the existing members. We consider two related problem formalizations that reflect the assumptions of our setting: small number of STC violations and strong-tie connectivity in the input communities. We show that both problem formulations are NP-hard. We also show that one problem formulation is hard to approximate, while for the second we develop an algorithm with approximation guarantee. We validate the proposed method on real-world datasets by comparing with baselines that optimize STC violations and community connectivity separately.",
          "Small-world effect plays an important role in the field of network science, and optimizing the small-world property has been a focus, which has many applications in computational social science. In the present study, we model the problem of optimizing small-world property as a multiobjective optimization, where the average clustering coefficient and average path length are optimized separately and simultaneously. A novel method for optimizing small-world property is then proposed based on the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition. Experimental results have proved that the presented method is capable of solving this problem efficiently, where a uniform distribution of solutions on the Pareto-optional front can be generated. The optimization results are further discussed to find specific paths for optimizing different objective functions. In general, adding edges within the same community is helpful for promoting ACC, while adding edges between different communities is beneficial for reducing APL. The optimization on networks with the feature of community structure is more remarkable, but community structure has less impact on the optimization when the internal community is triangles-saturated.",
          "Understanding how opinion leader characteristics influence network reconstruction represents a critical challenge in computational social science. This study presents a novel framework integrating leader-driven opinion dynamics with compressive sensing, systematically investigating how node centrality, initial opinion, acceptance rate, and opinion homogeneity affect reconstruction accuracy. The extensive experimental results for three real-world networks and three synthetic models show that leaders with lower centrality consistently outperform highly central nodes in network reconstruction. This occurs because high centrality leaders create rapid opinion convergence, reducing the informational diversity essential for accurate reconstruction, while lower centrality leaders preserve richer signal content. Our analysis shows that extremely conservative leaders (o=0.0) with high stubbornness (α=1.0) achieve optimal performance in moderately tolerant communities (ε=0.5), challenging conventional centrality-based leader selection strategies. These findings indicate that effective opinion leadership for network reconstruction requires consideration of dynamics-specific factors beyond traditional structural importance, with significant implications for marketing, public health interventions, and crisis communication applications.",
          "Large-scale networks have been instrumental in shaping how we think about social systems, and have undergirded many foundational results in mathematical epidemiology, computational social science, and biology. However, many of the social systems through which diseases spread, information disseminates, and individuals interact are inherently mediated through groups, known as higher-order interactions. A gap exists between higher-order models of group formation and spreading processes and the data necessary to validate these mechanisms. Similarly, few datasets bridge the gap between pairwise and higher-order network data. The Bluesky social media platform is an ideal laboratory for observing social ties at scale through its open API. Not only does Bluesky contain pairwise following relationships, but it also contains higher-order social ties known as \"starter packs\" which are user-curated lists designed to promote social network growth. We introduce \"A Blue Start\", a large-scale network dataset comprising 39.7M user accounts, 2.4B pairwise following relationships, and 365.8K groups representing starter packs. This dataset will be an essential resource for the study of higher-order networks.",
          "Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computational social science. A particularly common means to predict existence of unobserved links is via structural similarity metrics, such as the number of common neighbors; node pairs with higher similarity are thus deemed more likely to be linked. However, a number of applications of link prediction, such as predicting links in gang or terrorist networks, are adversarial, with another party incentivized to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the network. We offer a comprehensive algorithmic investigation of the problem of attacking similarity-based link prediction through link deletion, focusing on two broad classes of such approaches, one which uses only local information about target links, and another which uses global network information. While we show several variations of the general problem to be NP-Hard for both local and global metrics, we exhibit a number of well-motivated special cases which are tractable. Additionally, we provide principled and empirically effective algorithms for the intractable cases, in some cases proving worst-case approximation guarantees.",
          "Opinion dynamics is a central subject of computational social science, and various models have been developed to understand the evolution and formulation of opinions. Existing models mainly focus on opinion dynamics on graphs that only capture pairwise interactions between agents. In this paper, we extend the popular Friedkin-Johnsen model for opinion dynamics on graphs to hypergraphs, which describe higher-order interactions occurring frequently on real networks, especially social networks. To achieve this, based on the fact that for linear dynamics the multi-way interactions can be reduced to effective pairwise node interactions, we propose a method to decode the group interactions encoded in hyperedges by undirected edges or directed edges in graphs. We then show that higher-order interactions play an important role in the opinion dynamics, since the overall steady-state expressed opinion and polarization differ greatly from those without group interactions. We also provide an interpretation of the equilibrium expressed opinion from the perspective of the spanning converging forest, based on which we design a fast sampling algorithm to approximately evaluate the overall opinion and opinion polarization on directed weighted graphs. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world hypergraph datasets, demonstrating the performance of our algorithm.",
          "Understanding the drivers of human behavior is central to uncovering insights into how our social worlds are shaped. Modeling these social dynamics has widespread applications in computational social science such as driving information diffusion, targeting network interventions, economic forecasting, and designing public policies. This thesis centers on understanding influence, behavior, and social dynamics in socioeconomic networks to craft strategies that affect the evolution of these networks. Social influence is modeled using heterogeneous, group-level frameworks with large-scale behavioral data to uncover the temporal evolution of social dynamics and target network interventions. This enables analyzing inequality that only becomes emergent at the network-level to design networks that promote fairness and innovation. Hidden social groups have a dynamic influence on decision-making and behavior on networks. Using a community-based grounding for social influence in the context of decision prediction, we uncover latent influence dynamics behind social inequality while predicting future decision behavior. Further work studies how latent social groups evolve to predict a more comprehensive view of human behavior with observational datasets including features such as mobility and communication habits. Using a psychological account for social influence and latent groups, it was found that globally latent groups are most predictive of future behavior. These group-level influence dynamics reveal significant macro patterns driving broader collective phenomena and behavior, demonstrative of far-reaching applications in behavior change and enacting social policy. These aggregate influence frameworks have also been applied to salient real-world contexts, where regional social dynamics and interventions were estimated in regard to the interdependence of mobility behavior, social connectedness, and adherence to social policies in the US. Lastly, this thesis focuses on the design of socioeconomic network interventions to address issues of fairness and inequality, specifically in financial systems through network-level impact estimation. In the rising era of data availability, this dissertation demonstrates the utility of interpretable, heterogeneous frameworks for emergent collective influence dynamics on socioeconomic networks.",
          "Understanding the dynamics of reciprocation is of great interest in sociology and computational social science. The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2 game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that reciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our hypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations with features from trade interactions. Incorporating the number of trades (both before and after the initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be reciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC. More generally, we see strong correlations across the different networks and emphasize that network dynamics, such as reciprocation, cannot be studied in isolation on just a single type of connection.",
          "This paper deals with the modeling and estimation of the sociological phenomena called echo chambers and segregation in social networks. Specifically, we present a novel community-based graph model that represents the emergence of segregated echo chambers as a Markov bridge process. A Markov bridge is a one-dimensional Markov random field that facilitates modeling the formation and disassociation of communities at deterministic times which is important in social networks with known timed events. We justify the proposed model with six real world examples and examine its performance on a recent Twitter dataset. We provide model parameter estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood and, a Bayesian filtering algorithm for recursively estimating the level of segregation using noisy samples obtained from the network. Numerical results indicate that the proposed filtering algorithm outperforms the conventional hidden Markov modeling in terms of the mean-squared error. The proposed filtering method is useful in computational social science where data-driven estimation of the level of segregation from noisy data is required.",
          "This paper conducts a rigorous, multi-disciplinary examination of the proverbial assertion, \"Tell me who you walk with, and I’ll tell you who you are.\" Moving beyond its folkloric origins, the analysis establishes the phrase as a foundational heuristic for understanding social identity forma­tion, employing lenses from sociology, social psychology, network theory, and computational social science. The central thesis posits that an individ­ual’s affiliations–their proximal and enduring social connections–serve as powerful determinants, predictors, and mirrors of their composite identity, encompassing values, behaviors, socioeconomic status, and cognitive pat­terns. We first deconstruct the maxim’s theoretical underpinnings, linking it to established concepts like homophily, social influence, symbolic interac­tionism, and habitus. Subsequently, we propose and formalize methodolog­ical frameworks for its empirical validation, including longitudinal social network analysis, natural language processing of communicative patterns, and controlled behavioral experiments. A synthesized review of empirical evidence demonstrates robust correlations between network composition and individual outcomes across domains such as academic performance, health behaviors, political affiliation, and career trajectories. The discus­sion critically addresses the dialectic between structure and agency, the mechanisms of social contagion, and the ethical implications of predictive profiling based on association.

          "A social tie is a target for ongoing, high-level scientific debate. Measuring the tie strength in social networks has been an important topic for academic studies since Mark Granovetter's seminal papers in 1970's. However, it is still a problematic issue mainly for two reasons: 1) existing tie strength measurements may not reflect the true social connections of individuals accurately enough, and 2) many different methods to gather data from social media are not applicable anymore due to different data openness issues. In addition, we have only little empirical knowledge of the actual tie strengthening process in online social networks. Therefore, we suggest a new approach to tie strength research, which focuses on studying communication patterns (edges) more rather than actors (nodes) in a social network.<br/>In this paper we build a social network analysis-based approach to enable the evaluation of tie strength based on reciprocal interaction from publicly available Facebook data, and suggest that this approach could work as a basis for further tie strength studies. Our approach makes use of weak tie theory, and enables researchers to study micro-level interactions (i.e. discussions, messages, relationships) with large-scale social network analysis (SNA). This study provides a way to find relevant actors from publicly available data in the context of tie strengthening process, and answers how to take this stream of research closer to computational social science.",
          "Topological representations are rapidly becoming a popular way to capture and encode higher-order interactions in complex systems. They have found applications in disciplines as different as cancer genomics, brain function, and computational social science, in representing both descriptive features of data and inference models. While intense research has focused on the connectivity and homological features of topological representations, surprisingly scarce attention has been given to the investigation of the community structures of simplicial complexes. To this end, we adopt recent advances in symbolic embeddings to compute and visualize the community structures of simplicial complexes. We first investigate the stability properties of embedding obtained for synthetic simplicial complexes to the presence of higher order interactions. We then focus on complexes arising from social and brain functional data and show how higher order interactions can be leveraged to improve clustering detection and assess the effect of higher order interaction on individual nodes. We conclude delineating limitations and directions for extension of this work.",

          "Knowledge graphs have been shown to play a significant role in current knowledge mining fields, including life sciences, bioinformatics, computational social sciences, and social network analysis. The problem of link prediction bears many applications and has been extensively studied. However, most methods are restricted to dimension reduction, probabilistic model, or similarity-based approaches and are inherently biased. In this paper, we provide a definition of graph prediction for link prediction and outline related work to support our novel approach, which integrates centrality measures with classical machine learning methods. We examine our experimental results in detail and identify areas for potential further research. Our method shows promise, particularly when utilizing randomly selected nodes and degree centrality.",
          "People may change their opinions as a consequence of interacting with others. In the literature, this phenomenon is expressed as opinion formation and has a wide range of applications, including predicting social movements, predicting political voting results, and marketing. The interactions could be face-to-face or via online social networks. The social opinion phases are categorized into consensus, majority, and non-majority. In this research, we study phase transitions due to interactions between connected people with various noise levels using agent-based modeling and a computational social science approach. Two essential factors affect opinion formations: the opinion formation model and the network topology. We assumed the social impact model of opinion formation, a discrete binary opinion model, appropriate for both face-to-face and online interactions for opinion formation. For the network topology, scale-free networks have been widely used in many studies to model real social networks, while recent studies have revealed that most social networks fit log-normal distributions, which we considered in this study. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to consider the log-normal distribution network topology in phase transitions in the social impact model of opinion formation. The results reveal that two parameters affect the phase transition: noise level and segregation. A non-majority phase happens in equilibrium in high enough noise level, regardless of the network topology, and a majority phase happens in equilibrium in lower noise levels. However, the segregation, which depends on the network topology, affects opinion groups' population. A comparison with the scale-free network topology shows that in the scale-free network, which have a more segregated topology, resistance of segregated opinion groups against opinion change causes a slightly different phase transition at low noise levels.

To study this phenomenon, scholars focus on two central themes: 1) entrepreneurial actors (individuals, organizations, or firms in the community) with the right knowledge and motivation possess capabilities determine whether an identified opportunity represents an opportunity for them to exploit so as to alleviate others' sufferings, and 2) the feedback from an exploitation of an existing opportunity significantly influences the recognition and evaluation of subsequent opportunities of helping others. However, contemporary research has examined the first theme while largely ignoring the second one. Addressing this oversight, we develop three graph-theoretic models and operationlize them using the computational social science approach to investigate both the temporal dimension of entrepreneurial action as a process of opportunity identification, evaluation and exploitation over time, and the spatial dimension of entrepreneurial action as a feedback to identify subsequent opportunities among networked actors under disasters. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe first model depicts a simple supply-chain structure where each actor's entrepreneurial action can feed back to his/her spatially interdependent upstream and downstream neighbors. Our model suggests that feedback mechanisms significantly influence actors' entrepreneurial action decisions to alleviate the negative impacts of unanticipated disasters on supply chain performance. Next, we extend the one-dimensional chain structure into a grid network setting in the second model. This model highlights the importance of reciprocal feedback between neighboring actors in facilitating recovery entrepreneurial actions in the aftermath of disasters. Finally, our last model examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of entrepreneurial action over additional network structures, such as small-world and scale-free, determining how information and knowledge feedback circulates in the system facing disastrous events. We show that a shift in the network structure at the spatial dimension changes the number of actors who act entrepreneurially over time.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nIn sum, we consider entrepreneurial action emerging from the interactions among community members over not only time but also space in times of disasters. The modeling and analysis extends the action-based entrepreneurship framework into the context of disasters by explicitly specifying dynamic and interactive behavior among community members that are inputs to, and outcomes of, one another in the entrepreneurial process to alleviate the sufferings.",
          "Genealogical networks, also known as family trees or population pedigrees, are commonly studied by genealogists wanting to know about their ancestry, but they also provide a valuable resource for disciplines such as digital demography, genetics, and computational social science. These networks are typically constructed by hand through a very time-consuming process, which requires comparing large numbers of historical records manually. We develop computational methods for automatically inferring large-scale genealogical networks. A comparison with human-constructed networks attests to the accuracy of the proposed methods. To demonstrate the applicability of the inferred large-scale genealogical networks, we present a longitudinal analysis on the mating patterns observed in a network. This analysis shows a consistent tendency of people choosing a spouse with a similar socioeconomic status, a phenomenon known as assortative mating. Interestingly, we do not observe this tendency to consistently decrease (nor increase) over our study period of 150 years.",
          "Recent work argued that researchers conceptualize “social ties” in four fundamentally different ways—as socially constructed <italic>role relations</italic> such as friendship or coauthorship, <italic>sentiments</italic> such as liking or hatred, <italic>interactions</italic> such as communication or sex, and <italic>access</italic> to resources or opportunities. We consider where ties (and nonties) are likely to correspond across these four concepts, and thus assess where we may apply theories based on one network concept (e.g. sentiment ties of liking and disliking) to data representing another (e.g. interaction as logs of phone calls). Then we discuss empirical lenses emerging from computational social science, such as location-aware devices, electronic calendars, wearable sensors, records of electronic messages, phone calls, or online transactions. We ask how these timestamped event series correspond to the aforementioned conventional network concepts and call for a new analytical approach: directly theorizing and analyzing the structural-temporal interdependencies of interaction events redirects our attention from <italic>structural patterns</italic> to <italic>social processes</italic>.",
          "Though online social network research has exploded during the past years, not much thought has been given to the exploration of the nature of social links. Online interactions have been interpreted as indicative of one social process or another (e.g., status exchange or trust), often with little systematic justification regarding the relation between observed data and theoretical concept. Our research aims to breach this gap in computational social science by proposing an unsupervised, parameter-free method to discover, with high accuracy, the fundamental domains of interaction occurring in social networks. By applying this method on two online datasets different by scope and type of interaction (aNobii and Flickr) we observe the spontaneous emergence of three domains of interaction representing the exchange of status, knowledge and social support. By finding significant relations between the domains of interaction and classic social network analysis issues (e.g., tie strength, dyadic interaction over time) we show how the network of interactions induced by the extracted domains can be used as a starting point for more nuanced analysis of online social data that may one day incorporate the normative grammar of social interaction. Our methods finds applications in online social media services ranging from recommendation to visual link summarization.",
          "Multilayer network science has emerged as a central framework for analysing interconnected and interdependent complex systems. Its relevance has grown substantially with the increasing availability of rich, heterogeneous data, which makes it possible to uncover and exploit the inherently multilayered organisation of many real-world networks. In this review, we summarise recent developments in the field. On the theoretical and methodological front, we outline core concepts and survey advances in community detection, dynamical processes, temporal networks, higher-order interactions, and machine-learning-based approaches. On the application side, we discuss progress across diverse domains, including interdependent infrastructures, spreading dynamics, computational social science, economic and financial systems, ecological and climate networks, science-of-science studies, network medicine, and network neuroscience. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective, emphasizing the need for standardized datasets and software, deeper integration of temporal and higher-order structures, and a transition toward genuinely predictive models of complex systems.",
          "Advances in formal theories, network science, and data collection technologies make complex-agent networks and adaptive networks increasingly powerful tools in the fields' of complexity science and computational social science. We present DyNSimF; an open source package that facilitates the modelling of adaptive networks, capturing complex interacting dynamics on a network as well as dynamics of (the structure of) a network. Capable of complex agent-based simulations on a dynamic network, it is able to capture individual-level dynamics as well as dynamics of the network structure, and how these interact and evolve. By capturing the emergent behaviour resulting from the interactions of node states and network topology, we argue that DyNSimF will help modellers to gain a fundamentally better understanding of complex network systems. The package can handle both weighted and directional links, is computationally scalable and efficient, and includes a generic utility-based edge selection framework. DyNSimF provides a generic modelling framework for dynamics networks and includes visualisation methods and tools to aid in the analysis of models. It is designed to be extensible and aims to be easy to learn and work with, allowing non-experts to focus on model development, while being highly customisable and extensible to allow for complex custom models.",
          "This paper deals with the modeling and estimation of the sociological phenomena called segregation in social networks. Specifically, we present a novel community-based graph model that represent segregation as a Markov bridge process. A Markov bridge is a one-dimensional Markov random field that facilitates modeling the formation and disassociation of communities at deterministic times which is important in social networks with known timed events. Based on the proposed model, we provide Bayesian filtering algorithms for recursively estimating the level of segregation using noisy samples obtained from the graph. Numerical results indicate that the proposed filtering algorithm outperforms the conventional hidden Markov modeling in terms of the mean-squared error. The proposed filtering method is useful in computational social science where data-driven estimation of the level of segregation from noisy data is required.",
          "Computational Social Science (CSS) is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes computational methods, network analysis, and large-scale data processing techniques to study human social behavior, group interactions, and social dynamics. Inspired by CSS, this paper proposes a novel heuristic optimization algorithm, named the Social Cognition and Opinion Dynamics Optimizer (SCODO). This algorithm simulates the behavior and cognitive preferences of individuals in a network environment, optimizing the group search process through opinion propagation, social network dynamics, and individual innovation mechanisms. This paper provides a theoretical system design for the algorithm, detailing individual state modeling, social influence mechanisms, opinion hotspot mechanisms, dynamic network update mechanisms, and social innovation operators, and presenting complete mathematical formulas. The algorithm's originality lies in three aspects: first, the introduction of individual cognitive preference vectors to modulate neighbor influence; second, the opinion hotspot weighting mechanism to simulate the social propagation effect of high-quality solutions; and third, the dynamic network evolution and outlier-driven innovation operators to enhance search diversity and global exploration capabilities. This study provides a systematic methodology and mathematical modeling foundation for the design of optimization algorithms based on social science phenomena, and provides theoretical support for the future application of social behavior modeling to complex optimization problems.",
          "Abstract Preferential attachment, homophily, and their consequences such as scale-free (i.e. power-law) degree distributions, the glass ceiling effect (the unseen, yet unbreakable barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements) and perception bias are well-studied in undirected networks. However, such consequences and the factors that lead to their emergence in directed networks (e.g. author–citation graphs, Twitter) are yet to be coherently explained in an intuitive, theoretically tractable manner using a single dynamical model. To this end, we present a theoretical and numerical analysis of the novel Directed Mixed Preferential Attachment model in order to explain the emergence of scale-free degree distributions and the glass ceiling effect in directed networks with two groups (minority and majority). Specifically, we first derive closed-form expressions for the power-law exponents of the in-degree and out-degree distributions of each of the two groups and then compare the derived exponents with each other to obtain useful insights. These insights include answers to questions such as: when does the minority group have an out-degree (or in-degree) distribution with a heavier tail compared to the majority group? what factors cause the tail of the out-degree distribution of a group to be heavier than the tail of its own in-degree distribution? what effect does frequent addition of edges between existing nodes have on the in-degree and out-degree distributions of the majority and minority groups? Answers to these questions shed light on the interplay between structure (i.e. the in-degree and out-degree distributions of the two groups) and dynamics (characterized collectively by the homophily, preferential attachment, group sizes and growth dynamics) of various real-world directed networks. We also provide a novel definition of the glass ceiling faced by a group via the number of individuals with large out-degree (i.e. those with many followers) normalized by the number of individuals with large in-degree (i.e. those who follow many others) and then use it to characterize the conditions that cause the glass ceiling effect to emerge in a directed network. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments. The DMPA model and its theoretical and numerical analysis provided in this article are useful for analysing various phenomena on directed networks in fields such as network science and computational social science.",
          "Online social networks are growing and becoming denser. The social connections of a given person may have very high variability: from close friends and relatives to acquaintances to people who hardly know. Inferring the strength of social ties is an important ingredient for modeling the interaction of users in a network and understanding their behavior. Furthermore, the problem has applications in computational social science, viral marketing, and people recommendation. In this paper we study the problem of inferring the strength of social ties in a given network. Our work is motivated by a recent approach [27], which leverages the strong triadic closure (STC) principle, a hypothesis rooted in social psychology [13]. To guide our inference process, in addition to the network structure, we also consider as input a collection of tight communities. Those are sets of vertices that we expect to be connected via strong ties. Such communities appear in different situations, e.g., when being part of a community implies a strong connection to one of the existing members. We consider two related problem formalizations that reflect the assumptions of our setting: small number of STC violations and strong-tie connectivity in the input communities. We show that both problem formulations are NP-hard. We also show that one problem formulation is hard to approximate, while for the second we develop an algorithm with approximation guarantee. We validate the proposed method on real-world datasets by comparing with baselines that optimize STC violations and community connectivity separately.",
          "Social networks fundamentally shape our lives. Networks channel the ways that information, emotions, and diseases flow through populations. Networks reflect differences in power and status in settings ranging from small peer groups to international relations across the globe. Network tools even provide insights into the ways that concepts, ideas and other socially generated contents shape culture and meaning. As such, the rich and diverse field of social network analysis has emerged as a central tool across the social sciences. This Handbook provides an overview of the theory, methods, and substantive contributions of this field. The thirty-three chapters move through the basics of social network analysis aimed at those seeking an introduction to advanced and novel approaches to modeling social networks statistically. The Handbook includes chapters on data collection and visualization, theoretical innovations, links between networks and computational social science, and how social network analysis has contributed substantively across numerous fields. As networks are everywhere in social life, the field is inherently interdisciplinary and this Handbook includes contributions from leading scholars in sociology, archaeology, economics, statistics, and information science among others.",
          "When nodes can repeatedly update their behavior (as in agent-based models from computational social science or repeated-game play settings) the problem of optimal network seeding becomes very complex. For a popular spreading-phenomena model of binary-behavior updating based on thresholds of adoption among neighbors, we consider several planning problems in the design of \\textit{Sticky Interventions}: when adoption decisions are reversible, the planner aims to find a Seed Set where temporary intervention leads to long-term behavior change. We prove that completely converting a network at minimum cost is $\\Omega(\\ln (OPT) )$-hard to approximate and that maximizing conversion subject to a budget is $(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-hard to approximate. Optimization heuristics which rely on many objective function evaluations may still be practical, particularly in relatively-sparse networks: we prove that the long-term impact of a Seed Set can be evaluated in $O(|E|^2)$ operations. For a more descriptive model variant in which some neighbors may be more influential than others, we show that under integer edge weights from $\\{0,1,2,...,k\\}$ objective function evaluation requires only $O(k|E|^2)$ operations. These operation bounds are based on improvements we give for bounds on time-steps-to-convergence under discrete-time reversible-threshold updates in networks.",
          "<title>Abstract</title> In computer science, there exist a large number of optimization problems defined on graphs, that is to find a best node state configuration or a network structure such that the designed objective function is optimized under some constraints. However, these problems are notorious for their hardness to solve because most of them are NP-hard or NP-complete. Although traditional general methods such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA) and so forth have been devised to these hard problems, their accuracy and time consumption are not satisfying in practice. In this work, we proposed a simple, fast, and general algorithm framework based on advanced automatic differentiation technique empowered by deep learning frameworks. By introducing Gumbel-softmax technique, we can optimize the objective function directly by gradient descent algorithm regardless of the discrete nature of variables. We also introduce evolution strategy to parallel version of our algorithm. We test our algorithm on four representative optimization problems on graph including modularity optimization from network science, Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model from statistical physics, maximum independent set (MIS) and minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem from combinatorial optimization on graph, and Influence Maximization problem from computational social science. High-quality solutions can be obtained with much less time consuming compared to traditional approaches.",
          "Dense subgraph discovery is a fundamental problem in graph mining whose goal is to extract a dense subgraph from a given graph, and it has a wide range of applications [18]. However, numerous real-world applications, ranging from computational biology and computational neuroscience to computational social science, take as input a dual graph, namely a pair of graphs on the same set of nodes. Despite the large number of such applications, research on dense subgraph discovery has focused on a single graph input, with few notable exceptions [9, 22, 35, 36]. In this work, we contribute to this line of research by studying the following novel algorithmic problem:Given a pair of graphs G, H on the same set of nodes V, how do we find a subset of nodes S ⊆ V that induces a well-connected subgraph in G and a dense subgraph in H?Our formulation generalizes previous research [11, 44, 45], by enabling to control the connectivity constraint on G. We propose a mathematical formulation and prove that it is solvable exactly in polynomial time. We compare our method to state-of-the-art competitors and find empirically that controlling the connectivity constraint enables the practitioner to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Finally, we show that our proposed mining tool can be used to better understand how users interact on Twitter and connectivity aspects of human brain networks with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).MSC codesdense subgraph discoveryk-edge connectivitydual graphalgorithm designgraph mining",

          "Abstract As network research becomes more sophisticated, it is more common than ever for researchers to find themselves not studying a single network but needing to analyze sets of networks. An important task when working with sets of networks is network comparison, developing a similarity or distance measure between networks so that meaningful comparisons can be drawn. The best means to accomplish this task remains an open area of research. Here we introduce a new measure to compare networks, the Network Portrait Divergence, that is mathematically principled, incorporates the topological characteristics of networks at all structural scales, and is general-purpose and applicable to all types of networks. An important feature of our measure that enables many of its useful properties is that it is based on a graph invariant, the network portrait. We test our measure on both synthetic graphs and real world networks taken from protein interaction data, neuroscience, and computational social science applications. The Network Portrait Divergence reveals important characteristics of multilayer and temporal networks extracted from data.",
          "Web3, one of the novel paradigms which may drive the evolution of the future Web, is offering an invaluable volume of data stored in the supporting blockchains. Researchers from different fields such as network science, computational social science and data mining, might benefit from these large collections of temporal and heterogeneous data capturing different kinds of interaction among people and between people and the platforms. In this study we focus on a specific issue related to these modern techno-social systems, i.e. the understanding of the rules driving their growth. To reach this goal, we performed an analysis based on graph evolution rules - GERs - on different networks gathered from Web3 platforms such as Steemit or OpenSea. Graph evolution rules mining is a frequency-based method for evaluating network evolution which does not require any prior growth process for disentangling how networks evolve. By comparing the evolution rules of social network platforms and asset trading services through GER profiles, we observe that some evolution rules are common to all Web3 platforms, regardless of the system specificity. On the other hand, in specific cases, the frequency of graph evolution rules is influenced by the nature of the platform: whereas social and token-transfer networks are characterized by rules which increase network transitivity and reciprocity, NFT trading networks, especially those specialized in a specific type of digital asset, are driven by rules which form trading chains. These findings suggest that the GER approach and the GER profiles are a good starting point to get insights into the evolutionary behavior of a network and to define a classification of graph evolution rules.",
          "Human decision making underlies data generating process in multiple application areas, and models explaining and predicting choices made by individuals are in high demand. Discrete choice models are widely studied in economics and computational social sciences. As digital social networking facilitates information flow and spread of influence between individuals, new advances in modeling are needed to incorporate social information into these models in addition to characteristic features affecting individual choices. In this paper, we propose two novel models with scalable training algorithms: local logistics graph regularization (LLGR) and latent class graph regularization (LCGR) models. We add social regularization to represent similarity between friends, and we introduce latent classes to account for possible preference discrepancies between different social groups. Training of the LLGR model is performed using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and training of the LCGR model is performed using a specialized Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Scalability to large graphs is achieved by parallelizing computation in both the expectation and the maximization steps. The LCGR model is the first latent class classification model that incorporates social relationships among individuals represented by a given graph. To evaluate our two models, we consider three classes of data to illustrate a typical large-scale use case in internet and social media applications. We experiment on synthetic datasets to empirically explain when the proposed model is better than vanilla classification models that do not exploit graph structure. We also experiment on real-world data, including both small scale and large scale real-world datasets, to demonstrate on which types of datasets our model can be expected to outperform state-of-the-art models.",
          "Big data open up unprecedented opportunities for investigating complex systems, including society. In particular, communication data serve as major sources for computational social sciences, but they have to be cleaned and filtered as they may contain spurious information due to recording errors as well as interactions, like commercial and marketing activities, not directly related to the social network. The network constructed from communication data can only be considered as a proxy for the network of social relationships. Here we apply a systematic method, based on multiple-hypothesis testing, to statistically validate the links and then construct the corresponding Bonferroni network, generalized to the directed case. We study two large datasets of mobile phone records, one from Europe and the other from China. For both datasets we compare the raw data networks with the corresponding Bonferroni networks and point out significant differences in the structures and in the basic network measures. We show evidence that the Bonferroni network provides a better proxy for the network of social interactions than the original one. Using the filtered networks, we investigated the statistics and temporal evolution of small directed 3-motifs and concluded that closed communication triads have a formation time scale, which is quite fast and typically intraday. We also find that open communication triads preferentially evolve into other open triads with a higher fraction of reciprocated calls. These stylized facts were observed for both datasets.",
          "Information diffusion in social networks is a central theme in computational social sciences, with important theoretical and practical implications, such as the influence maximisation problem for viral marketing. Two widely adopted diffusion models are the independent cascade model where nodes adopt their behaviour from each neighbour independently, and the linear threshold model where collective effort from the whole neighbourhood is needed to influence a node. However, both models suffer from certain drawbacks, including a binary state space, where nodes are either active or not, and the absence of feedback, as nodes can not be influenced after having been activated. To address these issues, we consider a model with continuous variables that has the additional advantage of unifying the two classic models, as the extended independent cascade model and the extended linear threshold model are recovered by setting appropriate parameters. For the associated influence maximisation problem, the objective function is no longer submodular, a feature that most approximation algorithms are based on but is arguably strict in practice. Hence, we develop a framework, where we formulate the influence maximisation problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming and adopt derivative-free methods. Furthermore, we propose a customised direct search method specifically for the proposed diffusion model, with local convergence. We also show that the problem can be exactly solved in the case of linear dynamics by selecting nodes according to their Katz centrality. We demonstrate the rich behaviour of the newly proposed diffusion model and the close-to-optimal performance of the customised direct search numerically on both synthetic and real networks.",
          "In many domains of life, business and management, numerous problems are addressed by small groups of individuals engaged in face-to-face discussions. While research in social psychology has a long history of studying the determinants of small group performances, the internal dynamics that govern a group discussion are not yet well understood. Here, we rely on computational methods based on network analyses and opinion dynamics to describe how individuals influence each other during a group discussion. We consider the situation in which a small group of three individuals engages in a discussion to solve an estimation task. We propose a model describing how group members gradually influence each other and revise their judgments over the course of the discussion. The main component of the model is an influence network-a weighted, directed graph that determines the extent to which individuals influence each other during the discussion. In simulations, we first study the optimal structure of the influence network that yields the best group performances. Then, we implement a social learning process by which individuals adapt to the past performance of their peers, thereby affecting the structure of the influence network in the long run. We explore the mechanisms underlying the emergence of efficient or maladaptive networks and show that the influence network can converge towards the optimal one, but only when individuals exhibit a social discounting bias by downgrading the relative performances of their peers. Finally, we find a late-speaker effect, whereby individuals who speak later in the discussion are perceived more positively in the long run and are thus more influential. The numerous predictions of the model can serve as a basis for future experiments, and this work opens research on small group discussion to computational social sciences.",
          "Abstract Owing to rapid advances in available data and methods, social network analysis has recently been propelled into a new era: Instead of documenting patterns in static network structures, we are increasingly able to pinpoint the principles governing the evolution of these structures as well as how they emerged in the first place. In this essay, I trace the contours of this new trend. First, I describe foundational research on three mechanisms of network generation that have received particular attention in the literature: homophily, opportunity constraints, and structural balance. Next, I outline cutting‐edge research that has built on this foundation. In just the past several years, scholars have broadened prior approaches into larger, encompassing analytic frameworks; disentangled the various underlying processes that give rise to observed patterns in network structures; and distinguished between attribute‐driven network change and network‐driven attribute change—all largely thanks to advances in modeling tools that have overcome prior obstacles and enabled theoretical progress. Finally, I discuss three directions for future research. While recent scholarship has revolutionized our understanding of network dynamics, our grasp of how tie‐generating mechanisms operate and interact remains comparatively shallow; counterintuitive divisions exist between major sites of relational research and there remains much room for comparative work; and for all the promise of computational social science, there is risk that this movement will return us to the descriptive techniques of prior days but on a much larger scale.",
          "This article deals with the modeling and estimation of the sociological phenomena called echo chambers and segregation in social networks. Specifically, we present a novel community-based graph model that represents the emergence of segregated echo chambers as a Markov bridge (MB) process. An MB is a 1-D Markov random field that facilitates modeling the formation and disassociation of communities at deterministic times, which is important in social networks with known timed events. We justify the proposed model with real-world examples and examine its performance on a recent Twitter dataset. We provide a model parameter estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood and a Bayesian filtering algorithm for recursively estimating the level of segregation using noisy samples obtained from the network. Numerical results indicate that the proposed filtering algorithm outperforms the conventional hidden Markov modeling in terms of the mean-squared error. The proposed filtering method is useful in computational social science where data-driven estimation of the level of segregation from noisy data is required.",
          "Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computational social science. A particularly common means to predict existence of unobserved links is via structural similarity metrics, such as the number of common neighbors; node pairs with higher similarity are thus deemed more likely to be linked. However, a number of applications of link prediction, such as predicting links in gang or terrorist networks, are adversarial, with another party incentivized to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the network. We offer a comprehensive algorithmic investigation of the problem of attacking similarity-based link prediction through link deletion, focusing on two broad classes of such approaches, one which uses only local information about target links, and another which uses global network information. While we show several variations of the general problem to be NP-Hard for both local and global metrics, we exhibit a number of well-motivated special cases which are tractable. Additionally, we provide principled and empirically effective algorithms for the intractable cases, in some cases proving worst-case approximation guarantees.",
          "Data has become an essential resource, which is used to guide decision making across many levels of society. To fully leverage the abundance of data sources, the various sources need to be integrated, which poses difficult computational challenges. Entity resolution techniques address these challenges by trying to identify data records referring to the same underlying entity. Often, relational information about the records (for example, a friendship network between the users of a social networking service) is available, but this information is ignored by the traditional entity resolution techniques. The goal of this thesis is to develop novel collective entity resolution methods which match records by leveraging relational information and produce an entity network. The developed methods are applicable to a wide array of applications - from bioinformatics to ontologies - but the initial motivation for this work has been the problem of integrating genealogical data to infer large-scale genealogical networks (family trees).&#13;\\nThis thesis makes the following methodological contributions: First, we develop novel methods for linking vital records, such as birth records, to infer genealogical networks. An experimental evaluation of the inferred networks shows that even fully automatic methods can produce fairly accurate networks, and moreover, the estimated link probabilities provide a reliable way to quantify the certainty of the inferred family relationships. Second, we propose methods with theoretical guarantees for aggregating the edges of directed acyclic graphs in the case that the correspondance between input-graph nodes is known. Third, if the correspondance is unknown, an alignment between the nodes has to be found. We study the resulting network alignment problem and propose methods for aligning multiple networks and for aligning networks actively by leveraging human experts.&#13;\\nThe proposed vital-record linking methods have been employed to automatically link a dataset of five million historical birth records from Finland. To visualize the resulting network and to enable the exploration of the inferred links, we have developed an online tool called AncestryAI, which has been used so far by thousands of genealogists in Finland. In the final part of the thesis, we demonstrate the usefullness of the inferred genealogical network for the field of computational social science by presenting a longitudinal analysis on assortative mating, that is, the tendency to marry someone with a similar socioeconomic status. This phenomenon is quantified by comparing the socioeconomic statuses of the automatically inferred spouses. We find evidence that assortative mating existed in Finland (1735-1885), but interestingly, we do not observe any monotonically decreasing or increasing trend in the strength of assortative mating.",
          "Uncertainty about models and data is ubiquitous in the computational social sciences, and it creates a need for robust social network algorithms, which can simultaneously provide guarantees across a spectrum of models and parameter settings. We begin an investigation into this broad domain by studying robust algorithms for the Influence Maximization problem, in which the goal is to identify a set of k nodes in a social network whose joint influence on the network is maximized. We define a Robust Influence Maximization framework wherein an algorithm is presented with a set of influence functions, typically derived from different influence models or different parameter settings for the same model. The different parameter settings could be derived from observed cascades on different topics, under different conditions, or at different times. The algorithm's goal is to identify a set of k nodes who are simultaneously influential for all influence functions, compared to the (function-specific) optimum solutions.",
          "Small-world effect plays an important role in the field of network science, and optimizing the small-world property has been a focus, which has many applications in computational social science. In the present study, we model the problem of optimizing small-world property as a multiobjective optimization, where the average clustering coefficient and average path length are optimized separately and simultaneously. A novel method for optimizing small-world property is then proposed based on the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition. Experimental results have proved that the presented method is capable of solving this problem efficiently, where a uniform distribution of solutions on the Pareto-optional front can be generated. The optimization results are further discussed to find specific paths for optimizing different objective functions. In general, adding edges within the same community is helpful for promoting ACC, while adding edges between different communities is beneficial for reducing APL. The optimization on networks with the feature of community structure is more remarkable, but community structure has less impact on the optimization when the internal community is triangles-saturated.",
          "Labor market institutions are central for modern economies, and their polices can directly affect unemployment rates and economic growth. At the individual level, unemployment often has a detrimental impact on people's well-being and health. At the national level, high employment is one of the central goals of any economic policy, due to its close association with national prosperity. The main goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into account the complex structure of labor market interactions. In particular, we explore the benefits of leveraging tools from computational social science, network science, and data-driven theories to measure the flow of opportunities and information in the context of the labor market. First, we investigate our key hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties, and this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the idea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities, where we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher than within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within related activities there are more \"capitals\" involved and that such activities require similar \"capabilities.\" Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic activities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow of opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow using a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).",
          "Digital networks have profoundly transformed the ways in which individuals interact, exchange information, and establish connections, leading to the emergence of phenomena such as virality, misinformation cascades, and online polarization. This review conducts a thorough examination of the micro-macro linkages within digital social networks, analyzing how individual actions like liking, sharing, and commenting coalesce into broader systemic patterns and how these interactions are influenced by algorithmic mediation. Utilizing a multidisciplinary literature base, this study explores the interaction among user behaviors, network structures, and platform algorithms that intensify biases, strengthen homophily, and foster echo chambers. We delve into crucial dynamics including the scalability's impact on weak tie propagation, the amplification effects on influencers, and the rise of digital inequalities, employing both theoretical and empirical approaches. By synthesizing insights from sociology, network theory, and computational social science, this paper underscores the necessity for novel frameworks that integrate algorithmic processes into established micro-macro models. The conclusion presents practical strategies aimed at promoting fairer digital networks through decentralized architectures, algorithmic fairness, and improved digital inclusion, tackling significant challenges such as polarization and misinformation within networked societies.",
          "Received entrepreneurship research suggests that entrepreneurial action helps people and communities in the aftermath of disastrous events. To study this phenomenon, scholars focus on two central themes: 1) entrepreneurial actors (individuals, organizations, or firms in the community) with the right knowledge and motivation possess capabilities determine whether an identified opportunity represents an opportunity for them to exploit so as to alleviate others' sufferings, and 2) the feedback from an exploitation of an existing opportunity significantly influences the recognition and evaluation of subsequent opportunities of helping others. However, contemporary research has examined the first theme while largely ignoring the second one. Addressing this oversight, we develop three graph-theoretic models and operationlize them using the computational social science approach to investigate both the temporal dimension of entrepreneurial action as a process of opportunity identification, evaluation and exploitation over time, and the spatial dimension of entrepreneurial action as a feedback to identify subsequent opportunities among networked actors under disasters. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nThe first model depicts a simple supply-chain structure where each actor's entrepreneurial action can feed back to his/her spatially interdependent upstream and downstream neighbors. Our model suggests that feedback mechanisms significantly influence actors' entrepreneurial action decisions to alleviate the negative impacts of unanticipated disasters on supply chain performance. Next, we extend the one-dimensional chain structure into a grid network setting in the second model. This model highlights the importance of reciprocal feedback between neighboring actors in facilitating recovery entrepreneurial actions in the aftermath of disasters. Finally, our last model examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of entrepreneurial action over additional network structures, such as small-world and scale-free, determining how information and knowledge feedback circulates in the system facing disastrous events. We show that a shift in the network structure at the spatial dimension changes the number of actors who act entrepreneurially over time.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nIn sum, we consider entrepreneurial action emerging from the interactions among community members over not only time but also space in times of disasters. The modeling and analysis extends the action-based entrepreneurship framework into the context of disasters by explicitly specifying dynamic and interactive behavior among community members that are inputs to, and outcomes of, one another in the entrepreneurial process to alleviate the sufferings.",

          "Computational Social Science (CSS) is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes computational methods, network analysis, and large-scale data processing techniques to study human social behavior, group interactions, and social dynamics. Inspired by CSS, this paper proposes a novel heuristic optimization algorithm, named the Social Cognition and Opinion Dynamics Optimizer (SCODO). This algorithm simulates the behavior and cognitive preferences of individuals in a network environment, optimizing the group search process through opinion propagation, social network dynamics, and individual innovation mechanisms. This paper provides a theoretical system design for the algorithm, detailing individual state modeling, social influence mechanisms, opinion hotspot mechanisms, dynamic network update mechanisms, and social innovation operators, and presenting complete mathematical formulas. The algorithm's originality lies in three aspects: first, the introduction of individual cognitive preference vectors to modulate neighbor influence; second, the opinion hotspot weighting mechanism to simulate the social propagation effect of high-quality solutions; and third, the dynamic network evolution and outlier-driven innovation operators to enhance search diversity and global exploration capabilities. This study provides a systematic methodology and mathematical modeling foundation for the design of optimization algorithms based on social science phenomena, and provides theoretical support for the future application of social behavior modeling to complex optimization problems.",
          "With improvements in data resolution and quality, researchers can now represent complex systems as signed, weighted, and directed networks. In this article, we introduce a framework for measuring net and indirect effects without simplifying these information-rich networks. It captures both direct and indirect interactions, the effect of the whole network on a node, and conversely, the effect of a node on the entire network, while accommodating the complexity of signed, weighted, and directed links. Our taxonomy unifies and extends existing approaches and measures from network science, computational social science, and ecological networks. We demonstrate its value in ecological systems, where net and indirect effects are critical yet difficult to quantify. Using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, we find a strong correlation between negative net effects and species extinction. We further apply the framework to a real-world social network, where it identifies informative rankings that illuminate influence propagation and power dynamics.",
          "Abstract The paper presents the analysis on link prediction algorithm for social network. Link prediction is one of the essential problems in computational social science. A principally general means to predict subsistence of unnoticed links is via structural similarity metrics, such as the number of common neighbors; node pairs with higher similarity are thus deemed more expected to be linked. There have been many algorithms to solve for the link prediction for social network. In this paper, the appropriate algorithm for link prediction problem for social network has been proposed. The results for numerical analysis confirm that the analysis on link prediction algorithm is to solve for the social network.

          "The analysis of super‐dyadic relations through hypergraphs is gradually gaining attention, with its community structure analysis playing a crucial role in computational social science. However, few scholars have paid attention to the impact of hyperedge diversity on the community structure of hypergraphs, especially the impact generated by heterogeneous hyperedges. This paper expands hypergraphs into signed hypergraphs and proposes a framework for community structure in signed hypergraphs along with a variant of modularity. Simultaneously, an optimization algorithm is introduced in this paper to detect potential communities by maximizing modularity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can effectively optimize the objective function and detect community structures.",
          "This paper deals with the modeling and estimation of the sociological phenomena called segregation in social networks. Specifically, we present a novel community-based graph model that represent segregation as a Markov bridge process. A Markov bridge is a one-dimensional Markov random field that facilitates modeling the formation and disassociation of communities at deterministic times which is important in social networks with known timed events. Based on the proposed model, we provide Bayesian filtering algorithms for recursively estimating the level of segregation using noisy samples obtained from the graph. Numerical results indicate that the proposed filtering algorithm outperforms the conventional hidden Markov modeling in terms of the mean-squared error. The proposed filtering method is useful in computational social science where data-driven estimation of the level of segregation from noisy data is required.",
          "Opinion dynamics is a central subject of computational social science, and various models have been developed to understand the evolution and formulation of opinions. Existing models mainly focus on opinion dynamics on graphs that only capture pairwise interactions between agents. In this article, we extend the popular Friedkin–Johnsen model for opinion dynamics on graphs to hypergraphs, which describe higher order interactions occurring frequently on real networks, especially social networks. To achieve this, based on the fact that for linear dynamics, the multiway interactions can be reduced to effective pairwise node interactions, we propose a method to decode the group interactions encoded in hyperedges by undirected edges or directed edges in graphs. We then show that higher order interactions play an important role in the opinion dynamics since the overall steady-state expressed opinion and polarization differ greatly from those without group interactions. We also provide an interpretation of the equilibrium expressed opinion from the perspective of the spanning converging forest, based on which we design a fast sampling algorithm to approximately evaluate the overall opinion and opinion polarization on directed weighted graphs. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world hypergraph datasets, demonstrating the performance of our algorithm.",
          "Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computational social science. A particularly common means to predict existence of unobserved links is via structural similarity metrics, such as the number of common neighbors; node pairs with higher similarity are thus deemed more likely to be linked. However, a number of applications of link prediction, such as predicting links in gang or terrorist networks, are adversarial, with another party incentivized to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the network. We offer a comprehensive algorithmic investigation of the problem of attacking similarity-based link prediction through link deletion, focusing on two broad classes of such approaches, one which uses only local information about target links, and another which uses global network information. While we show several variations of the general problem to be NP-Hard for both local and global metrics, we exhibit a number of well-motivated special cases which are tractable. Additionally, we provide principled and empirically effective algorithms for the intractable cases, in some cases proving worst-case approximation guarantees.",
          "Abstract Purpose The research community currently employs four very different versions of the social network concept: A social network is seen as a set of socially constructed role relations (e.g., friends, business partners), a set of interpersonal sentiments (e.g., liking, trust), a pattern of behavioral social interaction (e.g., conversations, citations), or an opportunity structure for exchange. Researchers conventionally assume these conceptualizations are interchangeable as social ties, and some employ composite measures that aim to capture more than one dimension. Even so, important discrepancies often appear for non-ties (as dyads where a specific role relation or sentiment is not reported, a specific form of interaction is not observed, or exchange is not possible). Methodology/Approach Investigating the interplay across the four definitions is a step toward developing scope conditions for generalization and application of theory across these domains. Research Implications This step is timely because emerging tools of computational social science – wearable sensors, logs of telecommunication, online exchange, or other interaction – now allow us to observe the fine-grained dynamics of interaction over time. Combined with cutting-edge methods for analysis, these lenses allow us to move beyond reified notions of social ties (and non-ties) and instead directly observe and analyze the dynamic and structural interdependencies of social interaction behavior. Originality/Value of the Paper This unprecedented opportunity invites us to refashion dynamic structural theories of exchange that advance “beyond networks” to unify previously disjoint research streams on relationships, interaction, and opportunity structures."

In dieser Studie untersuche ich, wie österreichische Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten sich, ihre Therapieangebote, sowie alternative Praktiken außerhalb der klinischen Psychologie präsentieren. Nach dem Web-Scraping von Texten ihrer persönlichen Websites führte ich zwei Analysen mit dem Datensatz durch. Um Muster in der Selbstdarstellung von Therapeutinnen und Therapeuten zu finden, berechnete ich Structural Topic Models für Methoden- (N = 232) und Über mich- (N = 245) Seiten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Therapeutinnen und Therapeuten bestimmte Sprache verwenden, um Kompetenz zu signalisieren, jedoch keine konsistenten Muster zur Vermittlung von Wärme erkennbar waren. Außerdem zeigte sich, dass auf den Websites Psychotherapie durch logistische Informationen und Erklärungen von therapeutischen Ansätzen zugänglicher gemacht wurde. In einer zweiten Analyse untersuchte ich, wie oft Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten alternative Praktiken erwähnen und führte eine Clusteranalyse durch, um Muster in den Erwähnungen zu finden (N = 152). Verschiedene alternative Praktiken wurden genannt, wovon die meisten der am häufigsten erwähnten Anwendung in psychotherapeutischen Methoden in Österreich finden oder Gegenstand aktueller empirischer, psychologischer Forschung sind.

Mit diesen und weiteren Fragen beschäftigt sich Mareike Wieland, wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin in der Abteilung Computational Social Science am Gesis – Leibniz-Institut für Sozialwissenschaften in Köln, in ihrer Dissertation. Die Publikation, welche im Rahmen des Herbert von Halem Promotions-Förderpreis erschienen ist, beleuchtet zunächst die Rolle (Sozialer) Medien bei der politischen Informationsaufnahme und die Bedeutung der Informiertheit sowie der aktiven Nachrichtensuche. Die Autorin definiert dafür den Nachrichtenbegriff und betrachtet den passiven Nachrichtenkonsum, wobei sie auf die Gefahren von Echokammern und Filterblasen hinweist. Außerdem zeigt sie auf, dass die ständige Konfrontation mit Nachrichten nicht zwangsläufig zu faktischem Wissen, sondern oft lediglich zu einem Gefühl des Wissenszuwachses führt. Des Weiteren werden die Charakteristika Sozialer Medien sowie deren Prinzipien und Wirkmechanismen untersucht, darunter Ent- und Neubündelung, Personalisierung und Konvergenz. Wieland erläutert die Bedeutung des Smartphones und die kognitive Verarbeitung nicht-intendierter Nachrichtenkontakte. Außerdem werden der Begriff des Automatismus sowie der Verlauf des Cycle of Distraction erklärt. Im zweiten Teil des Buches stellt die Autorin die Ziele ihrer Studie, das empirische Forschungsmodell sowie die Vor- und die Hauptstudie mit Hypothesen, Forschungsfragen, Methodik und Datenanalyse vor.

В настоящей работе нами предлагается метод выявления различий в индивидуальной семантике слов на основе автоматически рассчитанных оценок ассоциативного значения слова по шкалам семантического дифференциала. Используя дистрибутивную семантическую модель word2vec, обученную на многомиллионном корпусе текстов, и метод Concept Mover's Distance, мы получили для каждого ассоциативного ряда оценки по 18 шкалам семантического дифференциала. В нашей работе впервые данный метод, активно использующийся в новейших работах, рассматривающих текст как данные (преимущественно выполненных в русле computational social science), применяется по отношению к такому объекту анализа, как ассоциативный ряд, с целью описания индивидуальных различий в семантике слов. В качестве материала для исследования мы использовали специально созданный датасет, содержащий ассоциативные реакции к словам-стимулам, важным для русского языкового сознания, данные о психологических характеристиках респондентов (черты «Большой пятерки») и их эмоциональном состоянии в момент прохождения тестирования. Применяя комплекс методов анализа многомерных данных (метод главных компонент, факторный анализ, иерархическая кластеризация на главных компонентах), мы разделили слова-стимулы на группы в зависимости от выраженности индивидуальных различий в их семантике. Нами также была установлена связь эмоционально-психологических характеристик респондентов и автоматически рассчитанных оценок ассоциативного значения слов-стимулов по шкалам семантического дифференциала. Описанная методика анализа может применяться для получения оценок ассоциативных рядов (а также контекстов употребления слов в текстах) по любым семантическим оппозициям и предлагается как дополнение к традиционным методам выявления психологически реального значения слова. Используемый в работе датасет и код для воспроизведения полученных результатов на языке R доступны для исследователей.",

          "La traçabilité sans précédent des pratiques sociales réactive des clivages qui ont divisé les sciences depuis le xix e siècle. L’abondance des données et la puissance de leur traitement semblent fragiliser la sociologie, alors même que la physique ou l’informatique investissent activement ses problématiques de prédilection. La sociologie n’aurait plus le monopole du social, dont les relations ne seraient pas si singulières, et pourrait faire l’objet de traitements éprouvés par les sciences de la nature. Afin de mieux saisir les enjeux relatifs au déploiement des dispositifs numériques à l’ensemble des pratiques contemporaines, nous proposons de distinguer l’évolution des relations sociales de l’observation de ces relations, de la production de connaissances et, enfin, de la production de sens, comme autant de « remédiations numériques ». Nous n’assisterions ainsi pas tant à une crise de la sociologie empirique qu’à la résurgence de l’idéal d’une physique sociale opposant aux qualités de l’interprétation la puissance de l’efficience. En faisant l’économie de plus d’un siècle de sciences sociales, ce projet promu par une science sociale computationnelle entretient pourtant de nombreux malentendus et une négligence surprenante de la réflexivité, récusant activement le propre de l’humain au profit de lois supposées universelles.",
          "La circolazione ad accesso aperto dei risultati della ricerca, in particolare di quelli finanziati con fondi pubblici, riveste un ruolo prioritario per il progresso scientifico, economico, sociale e culturale di ogni paese. L’accesso aperto consente di migliorare l’intero ciclo dell’informazione scientifica e contribuisce a razionalizzare i processi e gli investimenti della ricerca, accrescere la qualità dei risultati, diffondere la conoscenza scientifica anche tra i non addetti ai lavori e infine favorire un rapporto più trasparente e più diretto tra la comunità scientifica e la cittadinanza. Nella prospettiva accesso aperto (open source, open government, open data, open culture, open science), il patrimonio digitale pubblico assume il ruolo di motore essenziale per la crescita di tutta la società. Da notare il ruolo di apripista svolto dal Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche che ha firmato già nel novembre 2012 la Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, coordina la partecipazione italiana a molte infrastrutture di ricerca europee, partecipa attivamente a progetti e infrastrutture europee per l’accesso aperto e coordina importanti progetti e infrastrutture nazionali a sostegno dell’istanza open, primo fra tutti la Science &amp;amp; Technology Digital Library del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. In sé e per sé, innovazione significa creazione di nuovi prodotti e servizi che portano sul mercato una nuova idea. Oggi si è d’accordo che la ricerca sia curiosity driven, ma abbia al contempo un impatto traslazionale, poiché è il trasferimento di conoscenze a rendere possibile l’innovazione, che è product driven, in quanto genera nuovi prodotti e linee di produzione. La lezione che governi e uomini di affari possono trarre dalla ricognizione compiuta nello Handbook of Global Science, Technology, and Innovation, curato da due ricercatori del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Daniele Archibugi e Andrea Filippetti , è che la forza della tradizione garantisce un vantaggio decisivo ma non assoluto: per preservare le proprie posizioni nella scienza e la propria competitività economica occorre che governi e industria operino su due strategie parallele. Da una parte una predisposizione a collaborare per acquisire e generare conoscenza, sia dei governi, tramite il finanziamento di programmi di ricerca pubblici (nazionali e transnazionali), sia delle imprese, in una concezione dell’innovazione aperta alla collaborazione piuttosto che la difesa settaria di diritti di proprietà intellettuale acquisiti. Dall’altra, la capacità di valorizzare dinamicamente le competenze acquisite in decenni e spesso addirittura in secoli, come insegna l’esperienza dei distretti industriali, vista la persistente tendenza delle attività economiche ad alta intensità di conoscenza ad agglomerarsi in spazi geografici limitati. L’innovazione è competenza, non esclusiva ma certamente principale, dei consigli nazionali delle ricerche di tutto il mondo, istituzioni assai diverse dalle università e dalle accademie, che risalgono rispettivamente al Medioevo e al Rinascimento. Le università hanno come missione l’insegnamento e i professori sono però liberi di insegnare e fare ricerca su cosa piace loro di più; mentre le accademie furono istituite dai re che volevano che degli scienziati vivessero a corte per avere risposte su questioni di loro, dei re, interesse. I consigli nazionali delle ricerche, invece, furono istituiti attorno alla prima guerra mondiale per ottenere risultati di rilevanza strategica per i loro paesi. Infatti, a chi crede che la globalizzazione riduca il pianeta a un paesaggio uniforme, si può obiettare che questo non è vero nel caso di scienza, tecnologia e innovazione. Sembra anzi che i meccanismi di autoesaltazione operino efficacemente, rendendo poche località di eccellenza destinate a produrre idee, scoperte e innovazioni diffuse in tutto il mondo. Del resto, Archibugi e Filippetti rammentano quanto sia facile diventare periferia dell’impero scientifico e quanto invece sia difficile entrare nel club dei produttori di conoscenza. Governi e scienziati siano avvertiti: che ci sia dia da fare! Nel frattempo, «innovazione sociale e culturale» è un sintagma divenuto di uso corrente per via del nome usato dallo European Strategy Forum Research Infrastructures per il gruppo di lavoro che si occupa delle infrastrutture per le scienze umane e sociali . La grande sfida è l’ampliamento dalla data science alla computational social science e alle data humanities. Non a caso, le scienze umane e sociali sono entrate a pieno titolo nella Research Data Alliance . L’obiettivo è considerare gli aspetti scientifici e tecnologici in grado di offrire proposte innovative alle sfide sociali del nuovo millennio. Pensiamo a tecnologie abilitanti quali: NFC-Near Field Communication, CRM-Content Rights Management, Contents-Aware Networks (fruition and enjoyment), Low-Latency Networks (warning and security) e Huge-Bandwidth Networks (augmented reality). Le infrastrutture di ricerca si trasformano da infrastrutture digitali in infrastrutture sociali, per realizzare il passaggio dall’innovazione tecnologica, all’innovazione sociale e infine all’innovazione culturale. In sostanza, se è vero che vediamo i presupposti per la creazione di migliaia di posti di lavoro sostenibili e di elevata qualità, è anche vero che occorrono maggiori investimenti per garantire che tutti possano accedere all’internet ad alta velocità a prezzi accessibili, così come occorre una riforma delle leggi europee sul diritto d’autore che rafforzi i diritti dei creatori. Occorre soprattutto un equilibrio tra libertà dei contenuti e proprietà intellettuale che tuteli sia la libertà di fruizione dei contenuti che il diritto all’equa remunerazione dell’autore. Nel ruolo di attore principale per la costituzione di un’infrastruttura innovativa e integrativa, le infrastrutture di ricerca per le scienze umane e sociali hanno una responsabilità rilevante per il futuro dell’editoria nel suo senso più ampio. Il libro digitale e le sue complesse relazioni con le infrastrutture per la conservazione (long term digital preservation), l’accesso (digital libraries), la comunicazione (in Italia assicurata dal consorzio GARR per la ricerca pubblica) e l’esplorazione dei dati (data mining) stanno al centro della discussione. Certo, si può non far nulla e attendere l’ipotesi darwiniana di un modello di libro elettronico migliore di tutti che prima o poi si imporrà sugli altri modelli, probabilmente una combinazione di testi, audiovisivi, giochi e mappe spaziotemporali. Ma necessità storica a parte, occorre una discussione sulle politiche. Nei contributi che seguono, Emanuela Reale considera i sistemi d’incentivazione all’open access e alla open innovation, Paola Galimberti presenta la altmetrics, nuovo approccio per la determinazione dell’impatto e il controllo della qualità, Pietro Greco illustra la citizen science, uno dei cardini del nuovo approccio europeo al ruolo della scienza nella società, Elena Giglia espone l’intricato ambito diritto d’autore e nuovi modelli di business, Paolo Manghi, Leonardo Candela e Donatella Castelli spiegano a che punto siamo con la costruzione di tecnologie e sistemi digitali a supporto dell’Open Science, e infine Alberto Di Minin e Chiara De Marco chiudono con delle osservazioni sul rapporto tra open science e open innovation.",

          "Digitale nyhedsøkosystemer er under hastig forandring. Kunstig intelligens og digitale platforme ændrer fundamentalt, <i>hvordan nyheder produceres, samarbejdes om og spredes</i>. Denne afhandling undersøger derfor, hvordan nyhedsorganisationers lokale tilpasninger kan generere og ændre makrostrukturer vedrørende nyhedsdiversitet og samarbejde mellem organisationer i digitale nyhedsøkosystemer. Hvor tidligere forskning har fokuseret på platforme, imitation og nyhedsdiversitet som adskilte emner, mangler vi integreret og empirisk indsigt i, hvordan handlinger på mikroniveau – såsom interorganisatorisk samarbejde, genbrug af platformindhold og imitation vha. kunstig intelligens – skaber strukturelle effekter på makroniveau i digitale nyhedsøkosystemer. At adressere dette er afgørende, da digitale nyhedsøkosystemer i stigende grad formes af to tendenser: 1) indflydelse fra indholdsplatforme, såsom nyhedsbureauer, samt 2) fremkomsten af generativ kunstig intelligens (AI). I kølvandet på disse udviklinger opstår spørgsmålet om, hvordan diversitet i udbuddet af nyheder skabes og opretholdes som en af grundpillerne i et demokrati. En bred og mangfoldig nyhedsdækning er central for at sikre oplyste borgere, pluralistisk repræsentation og et samfunds modstandsdygtighed.<br/><br/>Med udgangspunkt i et <i>complex dynamics</i>-perspektiv betragter jeg digitale nyhedsøkosystemer som komplekse adaptive systemer, der udvikler sig gennem feedbackspiraler, lokale tilpasninger og sti-afhængighed. Dette perspektiv gør det muligt at indfange, hvordan lokale tilpasninger kan akkumulere og omforme økosystemet på måder, som central platformstyring alene ikke kan forklare. Metodisk anvender jeg mixed methods og en computational social science-tilgang og analyserer et omfattende datasæt bestående af over fem millioner danske nyhedsartikler publiceret mellem 2000 og 2022. På tværs af tre studier kombinerer jeg citationsnetværksanalyse, topic modeling, computer-baseret estimering af semantisk lighed, kvalitative interviews, arkivmateriale og simuleringsbaseret modellering, hvilket muliggør analyse af, hvordan lokale organisatoriske beslutninger – udløst af kriser eller ny teknologi – former strukturen og diversiteten i nyhedsøkosystemet over tid. <br/><br/>I kapitel 2 introducerer jeg begrebet <i>platform bypass</i> og viser, hvordan danske nyhedsorganisationer i forbindelse med en krise vedrørende det nationale nyhedsbureau Ritzau formåede at opretholde samarbejde gennem uformelle kanaler, på trods af deres store afhængighed af platformen før krisen. I stedet for at bryde sammen, reorganiserede økosystemet sig midlertidigt i en mere decentral struktur, hvilket illustrerer dets tilpasningsevne i mødet med usikkerhed.<br/><br/>I kapitel 3 udvikler jeg begrebet <i>platform reliance</i> og undersøger, hvordan forskellige grader af afhængighed af platformindhold påvirker nyhedsdiversitet. Jeg finder, at moderat afhængighed af platformindhold blandt nyhedsorganisationerne øger diversiteten på økosystemniveau, mens lav og høj afhængighed reducerer den. Dette udfordrer forestillingen om, at brugen af historier fra nyhedsbureauer nødvendigvis sænker nyhedsdiversitet, og understreger betydningen af relationen mellem platforme og professionelle aktører i skabelsen af makrostruktur.<br/><br/>I kapitel 4 simulerer jeg, hvordan selvstændige imiterende AI-agenter kan påvirke nyhedsdiversitet i fremtidige hypotetiske scenarier. Simulationen, der bygger på virkelige danske nyhedsdata fra 2022, viser, at AI-drevet imitation både kan føre til nedsat og øget diversitet – afhængigt af tre faktorer: diversiteten i det oprindelige nyhedsudbud som AI-agenterne imiterer, den valgte imitationsstrategi og udbredelsen af AI-genereret indhold. Resultaterne indikerer, at AI ikke har en entydig effekt, men at denne opstår i samspil med det eksisterende informationsmiljø.<br/><br/>Samlet set viser de tre studier, hvordan platforme, genbrug af nyhedsindhold og AI drevet imitation skaber effekter på makroniveau, og derved former struktur og diversitet i nationale nyhedsøkosystemer. Teoretisk bidrager afhandlingen med begreberne <i>platform bypass</i> og <i>platform reliance</i> til platformlitteraturen, introducerer AI-drevet imitation som en ny form for imitation, og anlægger et nyt complex dynamics-perspektiv til forskning i platform-baserede økosystemer. Fra et samfundsmæssigt syn giver resultaterne politisk relevante indsigter i, hvordan nyhedsdiversitet opretholdes – eller svækkes – i økosystemer, der i stigende grad præges af platforme og AI.",
          "<b>RESUMO</b>O SATA, denominado em português brasileiro Sistema de Análise de Textos Acadêmicos, constitui um software de código aberto voltado ao suporte para análises de conteúdo textual. A ferramenta inspira se no método proposto por Bardin (2020) e busca otimizar processos de extração, filtragem e exame estatístico de textos acadêmicos, com o objetivo de evidenciar padrões semânticos e linguísticos. O sistema apresenta especial utilidade para pesquisadores das áreas de Humanidades e Ciências Sociais, particularmente no campo da Geografia, pois disponibiliza recursos voltados à identificação de palavras chave, construção de bigramas, categorização lexical e outras métricas quantitativas. O SATA também integra fluxos de Processamento de Linguagem Natural e possibilita a exportação de dados para programas como o Gephi, que são empregados em análises de redes semânticas (Bastian, Heymann e Jacomy, 2009). A interface está inteiramente localizada para o português brasileiro, e o software vem sendo utilizado por grupos de pesquisa como o Grupo de Estudos Territoriais da Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa e o Grupo de Pesquisa Redes de Poder, Migrações e Dinâmicas Territoriais da Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste, que atuam em programas de mestrado e doutorado.<b>DECLARAÇÃO DE NECESSIDADE</b>No contexto brasileiro das Humanidades e das Ciências Sociais aplicadas à Geografia, observa se que muitos pesquisadores ainda dependem de procedimentos manuais ou semiautomáticos para lidar com grandes corpora textuais. Barreiras históricas, tais como a limitação de formação em programação, a escassez de infraestrutura e a desigualdade na oferta de capacitação técnica, contribuíram para dificultar a adoção de métodos computacionais (Metzler et al., 2016). Paralelamente, Modelos de Linguagem de Grande Escala transformaram profundamente o campo do Processamento de Linguagem Natural, ampliando possibilidades analíticas, porém, ao mesmo tempo, suscitando debates acerca da cobertura linguística, da transparência metodológica e da reprodutibilidade científica (Le Scao et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023). No caso do português brasileiro, importantes avanços ocorreram com modelos como o BERTimbau (Souza, Nogueira e Lotufo, 2020) e com desenvolvimentos mais recentes como os PT BR Encoders (Mello e Fonseca, 2024). Entretanto, ainda são escassas as ferramentas acessíveis, dotadas de interface gráfica, que permitam operacionalizar esses avanços para pesquisadores sem formação aprofundada em computação.O SATA busca suprir essa lacuna ao oferecer um sistema aberto, com interface gráfica e voltado à automatização de tarefas essenciais para a análise textual, como filtragem de palavras chave, geração de bigramas e produção de métricas lexicais, sem que seja necessário domínio avançado de linguagens de programação. A localização para o português brasileiro amplia o acesso às metodologias computacionais e fortalece práticas de pesquisa reprodutíveis no âmbito da Geografia Humana e áreas correlSATA.Além de facilitar procedimentos de análise de conteúdo, o SATA auxilia na investigação do modo como os discursos participam da constituição do espaço. Em Geografia Humana, o espaço é entendido como relacional e socialmente produzido, e não como um recipiente neutro (Lefebvre, 1991; Massey, 2005). Embora os Sistemas de Informação Geográfica sejam eficientes em tarefas de mapeamento e consulta espacial, suas estruturas discretas nem sempre contemplam dimensões processuais e discursivas da espacialidade. O SATA complementa a cartografia ao extrair redes semânticas e entidades diretamente dos textos, permitindo o acompanhamento da forma pela qual lugares, atores e relações são construídos, contestados e reorganizados em discursos científicos e políticos.<b>CARACTERÍSTICAS E USO</b>O sistema oferece recursos de filtragem textual, conversão de dados para tabelas, identificação de gênero em bases nominais, produção de estatísticas textuais e interface gráfica intuitiva baseada em bibliotecas como spaCy, Pandas, gender guesser e tkinter. Esses procedimentos permitem a extração de verbos, adjetivos e substantivos, a geração automatizada de bigramas em formato CSV, a classificação de gênero de nomes próprios e a obtenção de indicadores como frequência de palavras, diversidade lexical, entidades nomeadas e visualizações gráficas. A incorporação de análise de sentimento será realizada em atualizações futuras mediante o uso de modelos específicos para o português, tais como Stanza, NLPNet, UDPipe e versões abertas de Modelos de Linguagem de Grande Escala treinadas para o português brasileiro (Touvron et al., 2023), assegurando compromisso com a transparência e a independência frente a interfaces proprietárias.<b>REFERÊNCIAS</b>BARDIN, L.

          "Resumen El impacto social de la investigación universitaria está cada vez más bajo escrutinio por parte de las administraciones públicas. Según Dotti y Walczyk (2022), uno de los factores clave para que las universidades generen impacto social y aborden los principales retos contemporáneos es la colaboración con actores sociales y la divulgación del conocimiento más allá del ámbito académico. Numerosos proyectos de investigación ya operan fuera de laboratorios y facultades. Muchos de ellos se inscriben en el marco de la ciencia ciudadana, entendida como la participación activa del público general en tareas de investigación científica (Vohland et al., 2021). Aunque la ciencia ciudadana se aplica a disciplinas tan diversas como la ecología, la astronomía o las humanidades digitales, también puede abordar directamente retos sociales mediante la ciencia ciudadana social: una investigación participativa codiseñada e impulsada directamente por grupos ciudadanos que comparten una preocupación social (Bonhoure et al., 2023; Perelló, 2022). Para investigar estas preocupaciones sociales compartidas, las bibliotecas públicas pueden convertirse en un aliado imprescindible, no solo por sus infraestructuras y su implantación territorial, sino especialmente por su rol comunitario (Bonhoure et al., 2025; Bonhoure y Perelló, 2025; Cigarini et al., 2021). El objetivo de esta comunicación es analizar cómo el mundo académico y las bibliotecas públicas pueden unir fuerzas para abordar los retos sociales actuales y situados en contextos concretos. El análisis será a la vez conceptual, fundamentado en el marco más amplio de la ciencia abierta, y práctico, a través del estudio de tres proyectos de ciencia ciudadana social desarrollados en bibliotecas públicas de Catalunya. La comunicación también examinará cómo la divulgación científica, integrada de manera orgánica en cada fase del proceso de investigación, se convierte en un elemento clave de la investigación participada. Al ser presentada conjuntamente por una investigadora y la directora de una biblioteca pública, la comunicación incorpora además las perspectivas complementarias de ambos ámbitos. En el ámbito conceptual, se ha demostrado que las bibliotecas, y en particular las bibliotecas universitarias, tienen un gran potencial para incorporar y fortalecer la ciencia abierta (Santos-Hermosa y Boté-Vericad, 2024). Además, la ciencia ciudadana, uno de los ocho pilares de la política de ciencia abierta de la Unión Europea, puede reforzar el rol comunitario de las bibliotecas (Bonhoure et al., 2025; Cigarini et al., 2021). En esta comunicación se analizará la intersección conceptual entre la ciencia abierta, la ciencia ciudadana y el rol social de las bibliotecas públicas. En el ámbito práctico, y a partir del análisis de tres proyectos de ciencia ciudadana social implementados en bibliotecas públicas, se abordarán tres aspectos: 1) la relevancia de estos proyectos para afrontar retos sociales y la implicación de colectivos en situación de vulnerabilidad; 2) el papel de la divulgación científica en cada caso; y 3) los mecanismos que favorecen el impacto social y una colaboración exitosa entre las bibliotecas y las universidades. Los tres proyectos presentados, desarrollados en colaboración con cinco bibliotecas públicas de la Diputación de Barcelona, abordan retos sociales como el acceso a la vivienda, el valor del agua como bien común y la percepción del calor extremo por parte de los colectivos más vulnerables. Las bibliotecas, junto con asociaciones vecinales, organizaciones no gubernamentales orientadas a la integración social y centros educativos, contribuyen a fortalecer el acceso a la investigación de colectivos en situación de mayor vulnerabilidad. Entre estos se encuentran grupos de personas mayores, niños y adolescentes que viven situaciones socioeconómicas difíciles, usuarios de centros de acogida o de educación especial y, en general, residentes de barrios con indicadores socioeconómicos bajos y altamente expuestos al cambio climático. La divulgación científica se integra en cada etapa del proceso y permite explicar y poner en práctica conceptos como el cambio climático, el método científico o la ciencia de datos, acercando la ciencia de manera experiencial a los colectivos participantes. Asimismo, contribuye a combatir la desinformación y las noticias falsas.

Nous utilisons un échantillon de profils annotés au départ, et des graphes modélisant la proximité des profils, afin de catégoriser le reste de la population. Ce modèle exploite les communautés, représentant des profils assez proches pour supposer qu'ils partagent une posture similaire.

          "Disszertációm két kutatási projekt eredményeit ismerteti, egy-egy természetesnyelv-feldolgozási módszer társadalomtudományos alkalmazását bemutatva. Az értekezés első részében online antiszemitizmuskutatást végeztem, amelyben a Látens Dirichlet Allokáció nevű topikmodellezési eljárás segítségével elemeztem a Kuruc.info weboldalon található, zsidó szót tartalmazó cikkek és a hozzájuk érkezett kommentek korpuszát. A kutatás szorosan kapcsolódott ahhoz a munkához, amelyet az ELTE Research Center for Computational Social Science (ELTE RC2S2) kutatócsoportban Barna Ildikó témavezetőmmel 2018-ban kezdtünk meg, és amelyben az online gyűlöletbeszéd kutatására fókuszáltunk. Az értekezés második felében a Trianoni békeszerződéssel és a holokauszttal kapcsolatos online emlékezetpolitikai diskurzusokat vizsgáltam a disztribúciós szemantika, azon belül elsősorban szóbeágyazási vektortérmodellek segítségével a kormányoldali, nem kormánypárti és szélsőjobboldali médiatérben. A kutatás különös aktualitását az adta, hogy 2020-ban volt a Trianoni békeszerződés századik és a második világháborús haláltáborok felszabadításának és a holokauszt végének a 75. évfordulója. Ez a két esemény a magyar történelemben és a nemzeti emlékezetben kiemelt helyet foglal el, ugyanakkor a legmegosztóbb, identitásformáló témák közé tartozik, amely elválasztja egymástól a különböző ideológiai oldalakat és politikai orientációkat. Ugyan a koronavírus-járvány miatt ezek az évfordulók valamelyest kisebb publicitást kaptak, mint amire megelőzőleg számítottunk, az eseményekkel kapcsolatban kialakult diskurzus gazdag nyersanyagát jelentette kutatásunknak, amelyben több mint 25 ezer darab újságcikket dolgoztunk fel. A disszertáció két nagy fejezete közötti összekötő kapocs tehát a közös módszertani megközelítés, a természetesnyelv-feldolgozás eszközeinek alkalmazása. Az értekezés megírásával egyik fő célom, hogy a hazai társadalomtudományos közösség számára olyan módszereket mutassak be közérthető módon, ami reményeim szerint elősegíti majd ezek terjedését és alkalmazását különféle kutatásokban. Annak érdekében, hogy ez megvalósulhasson, a disszertáció elkészítéséhez használt programkódok jelentős részét szabadon hozzáférhetővé tettem egy GitHub repozitóriumban.",
          "Die Bewältigung und Analyse großer digitaler Textdaten, wie digitaler Chat- oder Social Mediadaten, stellt Ethnograf:innen noch immer vor Herausforderungen. Trotz zahlreicher Entwicklungen in den Digital Humanities und Computational Social Sciences stehen qualitative, induktive und subjektzentrierte Ansätze zum Umgang mit großen Textdaten bislang weniger im Fokus methodischer Lösungsansätze. Am Beispiel digitaler Chatdaten stellt dieser Beitrag ein Vorgehen vor, das große Textdaten strukturiert und analysiert, und ordnet dieses Vorgehen in den ethnografischen Forschungsprozess ein. Das Vorgehen greift auf Relationale Datenbanken und SQL als Datenbankabfragesprache zurück, um Chatdaten verwalten, umstrukturieren und befragen zu können, sodass diese für die qualitative Analyse handhabbar werden. Der Einbezug von Chatdaten ermöglicht nicht nur neue Erkenntnisse. Vielmehr ermöglicht das Vorgehen Ethnograf:innen gerade zu Forschungsbeginn, ein Gefühl für die Daten zu entwickeln und Nähe zum Feld herzustellen. Der Text diskutiert Möglichkeiten und Grenzen sowohl des Vorgehens als auch der Analyse schriftlicher Chatdaten im ethnografischen Forschungsprozess.",

          "Автор полагает, что современная социология находится в длительном кризисе и констатирует, что проект, выдвинутый ее основоположником О. Контом, согласно которому социология - это наука об обществе в целом, которая обобщает теории и эмпирические данные различных социальных наук ... не реализован (с. 20). В результате, как утверждается в статье, современная социология по сравнению с такими дисциплинами. как экономика и право, до сих пор выглядит аутсайдером. Для ее вывода из затянувшегося кризиса предлагается перейти к широкому использованию в ней методов системного моделирования и системного управления.

          "Resumen El impacto social de la investigación universitaria está cada vez más bajo escrutinio por parte de las administraciones públicas. Según Dotti y Walczyk (2022), uno de los factores clave para que las universidades generen impacto social y aborden los principales retos contemporáneos es la colaboración con actores sociales y la divulgación del conocimiento más allá del ámbito académico. Numerosos proyectos de investigación ya operan fuera de laboratorios y facultades. Muchos de ellos se inscriben en el marco de la ciencia ciudadana, entendida como la participación activa del público general en tareas de investigación científica (Vohland et al., 2021). Aunque la ciencia ciudadana se aplica a disciplinas tan diversas como la ecología, la astronomía o las humanidades digitales, también puede abordar directamente retos sociales mediante la ciencia ciudadana social: una investigación participativa codiseñada e impulsada directamente por grupos ciudadanos que comparten una preocupación social (Bonhoure et al., 2023; Perelló, 2022). Para investigar estas preocupaciones sociales compartidas, las bibliotecas públicas pueden convertirse en un aliado imprescindible, no solo por sus infraestructuras y su implantación territorial, sino especialmente por su rol comunitario (Bonhoure et al., 2025; Bonhoure y Perelló, 2025; Cigarini et al., 2021). El objetivo de esta comunicación es analizar cómo el mundo académico y las bibliotecas públicas pueden unir fuerzas para abordar los retos sociales actuales y situados en contextos concretos. El análisis será a la vez conceptual, fundamentado en el marco más amplio de la ciencia abierta, y práctico, a través del estudio de tres proyectos de ciencia ciudadana social desarrollados en bibliotecas públicas de Catalunya. La comunicación también examinará cómo la divulgación científica, integrada de manera orgánica en cada fase del proceso de investigación, se convierte en un elemento clave de la investigación participada. Al ser presentada conjuntamente por una investigadora y la directora de una biblioteca pública, la comunicación incorpora además las perspectivas complementarias de ambos ámbitos. En el ámbito conceptual, se ha demostrado que las bibliotecas, y en particular las bibliotecas universitarias, tienen un gran potencial para incorporar y fortalecer la ciencia abierta (Santos-Hermosa y Boté-Vericad, 2024). Además, la ciencia ciudadana, uno de los ocho pilares de la política de ciencia abierta de la Unión Europea, puede reforzar el rol comunitario de las bibliotecas (Bonhoure et al., 2025; Cigarini et al., 2021). En esta comunicación se analizará la intersección conceptual entre la ciencia abierta, la ciencia ciudadana y el rol social de las bibliotecas públicas. En el ámbito práctico, y a partir del análisis de tres proyectos de ciencia ciudadana social implementados en bibliotecas públicas, se abordarán tres aspectos: 1) la relevancia de estos proyectos para afrontar retos sociales y la implicación de colectivos en situación de vulnerabilidad; 2) el papel de la divulgación científica en cada caso; y 3) los mecanismos que favorecen el impacto social y una colaboración exitosa entre las bibliotecas y las universidades. Los tres proyectos presentados, desarrollados en colaboración con cinco bibliotecas públicas de la Diputación de Barcelona, abordan retos sociales como el acceso a la vivienda, el valor del agua como bien común y la percepción del calor extremo por parte de los colectivos más vulnerables. Las bibliotecas, junto con asociaciones vecinales, organizaciones no gubernamentales orientadas a la integración social y centros educativos, contribuyen a fortalecer el acceso a la investigación de colectivos en situación de mayor vulnerabilidad. Entre estos se encuentran grupos de personas mayores, niños y adolescentes que viven situaciones socioeconómicas difíciles, usuarios de centros de acogida o de educación especial y, en general, residentes de barrios con indicadores socioeconómicos bajos y altamente expuestos al cambio climático. La divulgación científica se integra en cada etapa del proceso y permite explicar y poner en práctica conceptos como el cambio climático, el método científico o la ciencia de datos, acercando la ciencia de manera experiencial a los colectivos participantes. Asimismo, contribuye a combatir la desinformación y las noticias falsas. En todos los casos se observa que una colaboración horizontal entre las bibliotecas y el mundo académico favorece el intercambio de conocimientos y el aprendizaje mutuo, una alianza que ya es señalada por la Federación Internacional de Asociaciones de Bibliotecarios y Bibliotecas (IFLA) en su último informe de tendencias (Dezuanni et al., 2024). Involucrar a la ciudadanía en proyectos de ciencia ciudadana en bibliotecas públicas no solo permite que las personas participantes se conviertan en verdaderas protagonistas, sino que también refuerza el rol de las bibliotecas como infraestructuras sociales (Klinenberg, 2018) y contribuye a generar nuevo conocimiento científico situado y de alto valor social.

          "La démocratie est fondée sur l’idée que les gouvernements sont sensibles à l’opinion des citoyens qu’ils sont élus pour représenter. Des mesures fiables de l’opinion publique sont requises afin de permettre aux élus de gouverner de manière efficace. Les sources traditionnelles d’information sur l’opinion publique se complexifient avec l’accroissement des modalités de communication et les changements culturels qui y sont associés. La diversification des technologies de l’information et de la communication ainsi que la forte baisse des taux de réponse aux enquêtes de sondages provoquent une crise de confiance dans les méthodes d’échantillonnage probabiliste classique. Une source d’information sur l’opinion publique de plus en plus riche, mais relativement peu exploitée, se présente sous la forme d’ensembles de données extraordinairement volumineuses et complexes, communément appelées Big Data. Ces données présentent de nombreux défis liés à l’inférence statistique, notamment parce qu’elles prennent généralement la forme d’échantillons non probabilistes. En combinant des avancées récentes en sciences sociales numériques, en statistiques et en technologie de l’information, cette thèse, constituée de trois articles, aborde certains de ces défis en développant de nouvelles approches, permettant l’extraction d’informations adaptées aux larges ensembles de données. Ces nouvelles approches permettent d’étudier l’opinion publique sous de nouveaux angles et ainsi de contribuer à des débats théoriques importants dans la littérature sur la recherche sur l’opinion publique en rassemblant les preuves empiriques nécessaires afin de tester des théories de la science politique qui n’avaient pas pu être abordées, jusqu’à présent, en raison du manque des données. Dans le premier article, sur le placement idéologique des utilisateurs sur les médias sociaux, nous développons un modèle permettant de prédire l’idéologie et l’intention de vote des utilisateurs sur les médias sociaux en se basant sur le jargon qu’ils emploient dans leurs interactions sur les plateformes de médias sociaux. Dans le second article, sur l’identité nationale au Canada, nous présentons une approche permettant d’étudier l’hétérogénéité de l’identité nationale en explorant la variance de l’attachement à des symboles nationaux parmi les citoyens à partir de données provenant d’un vaste sondage en ligne. Dans le troisième article portant sur les prédictions électorales, nous introduisons une approche se basant sur le concept de la sagesse des foules, qui facilite l’utilisation de données à grande échelle dans le contexte d’études électorales non-aléatoires afin de corriger les biais de sélection inhérents à de tels échantillons. Chacune de ces études améliore notre compréhension collective sur la manière dont les sciences sociales numériques peuvent accroître notre connaissance théorique des dynamiques de l’opinion publique et du comportement politique.",

          "Sampling the network structure of online social networks is a widely discussed topic as it enables a wide variety of research in computational social science and associated fields. However, analyzing and sampling contentful messages still lacks effective solutions. Previous work for retrieving messages from social networks either used endpoints that are not available to the general research community or analyzed a predefined stream of messages. Our work uses features of the Twitter API that we utilize to construct a data structure that optimizes the efficiency of requests sent to the social network. Moreover, we present a strategy for selecting users to sample, which improves the effectiveness of our query optimizing data structure by leveraging existing models of user behavior. Combining our data structure with our proposed algorithm, we can achieve a 92% sampling efficiency over long timeframes.",

          "Is there a limited supply of good image trademarks? Trademark law long rested on the assumption that there is an inexhaustible supply of good marks that provide businesses with sufficient economic advantages to engage in effective branding. However, this conventional wisdom has recently come under scrutiny as evidence has mounted that the number of effective word marks suffers from both depletion of good marks and congestion of similar marks within certain areas. Leveraging new advances in computational social science, we extend this analysis to the study of image marks. We find that there is little evidence for either congestion or depletion in image marks across the most popular areas, but do see some evidence for registered marks being more complex than unregistered marks.",
          "Abstract Social media data is widely analyzed in computational social science. Twitter, one of the largest social media platforms, is used for research, journalism, business, and government to analyze human behavior at scale. Twitter offers data via three different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). One of which, Twitter’s Sample API, provides a freely available 1% and a costly 10% sample of all Tweets. These data are supposedly random samples of all platform activity. However, we demonstrate that, due to the nature of Twitter’s sampling mechanism, it is possible to deliberately influence these samples, the extent and content of any topic, and consequently to manipulate the analyses of researchers, journalists, as well as market and political analysts trusting these data sources. Our analysis also reveals that technical artifacts can accidentally skew Twitter’s samples. Samples should therefore not be regarded as random. Our findings illustrate the critical limitations and general issues of big data sampling, especially in the context of proprietary data and undisclosed details about data handling.",
          "Obtaining social media demographic information using machine learning is important for efficient computational social science research. Automatic age classification has been accomplished with relative success and allows for the study of youth populations, but student classification—determining which users are currently attending an academic institution—has not been thoroughly studied. Previous work (He et al., 2016) proposes a model which utilizes 3 tweet-content features to classify users as students or non-students. This model achieves an accuracy of 84%, but is restrictive and time intensive because it requires accessing and processing many user tweets. In this study, we propose classification models which use 7 numerical features and 10 text-based features drawn from simple profile information. These profile-based features allow for faster, more accessible data collection and enable the classification of users without needing access to their tweets. Compared to previous models, our models identify students with greater accuracy; our best model obtains an accuracy of 88.1% and an F1 score of .704. This improved student identification tool has the potential to facilitate research on topics ranging from professional networking to the impact of education on Twitter behaviors.",

          "Social media play a key role in mobilizing collective action, holding the potential for studying the pathways that lead individuals to actively engage in addressing global challenges. However, quantitative research in this area has been limited by the absence of granular and large-scale ground truth about the level of participation in collective action among individual social media users. To address this limitation, we present a novel suite of text classifiers designed to identify expressions of participation in collective action from social media posts, in a topic-agnostic fashion. Grounded in the theoretical framework of social movement mobilization, our classification captures participation and categorizes it into four levels: recognizing collective issues, engaging in calls-to-action, expressing intention of action, and reporting active involvement. We constructed a labeled training dataset of Reddit comments through crowdsourcing, which we used to train BERT classifiers and fine-tune Llama3 models. Our findings show that smaller language models can reliably detect expressions of participation (weighted F1=0.71), and rival larger models in capturing nuanced levels of participation. By applying our methodology to Reddit, we illustrate its effectiveness as a robust tool for characterizing online communities in innovative ways compared to topic modeling, stance detection, and keyword-based methods. Our framework contributes to Computational Social Science research by providing a new source of reliable annotations useful for investigating the social dynamics of collective action.",
          "Computational Social Science (CSS), aiming at utilizing computational methods to address social science problems, is a recent emerging and fast-developing field. The study of CSS is data-driven and significantly benefits from the availability of online user-generated contents and social networks, which contain rich text and network data for investigation. However, these large-scale and multi-modal data also present researchers with a great challenge: how to represent data effectively to mine the meanings we want in CSS? To explore the answer, we give a thorough review of data representations in CSS for both text and network. Specifically, we summarize existing representations into two schemes, namely symbol-based and embedding-based representations, and introduce a series of typical methods for each scheme. Afterwards, we present the applications of the above representations based on the investigation of more than 400 research articles from 6 top venues involved with CSS. From the statistics of these applications, we unearth the strength of each kind of representations and discover the tendency that embedding-based representations are emerging and obtaining increasing attention over the last decade. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and open issues for future directions. This survey aims to provide a deeper understanding and more advisable applications of data representations for CSS researchers.",
          "Over the past two decades, social media has been widely used to connect, socialize, and share content across the world. Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ produce enormous amounts of data by and about users. This data can be used to predict hidden or latent attributes of a user like gender, age group, political inclination, regional origin, and many others, with applications in targeted advertising, recommendations, and personalization. While there is significant prior work on trying to predict attributes like age and gender, our work focuses on predicting the educational level of users from their Twitter feed. Specifically, we try to determine if a user is in high school or has (or is working on) a Ph.D. We use a machine learning approach to predict the educational level of Twitter users by looking at their tweet stream using Support Vector Machines, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes. We extract features from each class that clearly describe the characteristics of tweets from members of the classes. We also attempt to discover the abstract topics that occur in this dataset using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. These user attributes provide a very useful source of information for a variety of applications like advertising, search, friend recommendation, computational social science and many more.",

Results. We demonstrate that our knowledge graph embedding method is superior at distinguishing pairs of articles with and without citation. Once trained, it runs efficiently and can be fine-tuned on specific corpora to suit individual researcher needs. Conclusions. This experiment demonstrates that the relationships encoded in a knowledge graph, especially the types of concepts brought together by specific relations can encode information capable of revealing intellectual influence. This suggests that further work in analysing document level knowledge graphs to understand latent structures could provide valuable insights.",
          "At the end of October 2022, Elon Musk concluded his acquisition of Twitter. In the weeks and months before that, several questions were publicly discussed that were not only of interest to the platform's future buyers, but also of high relevance to the Computational Social Science research community.

          "The proliferation of social network data has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for extensive, data-driven exploration of human behavior. The structural intricacies of social networks offer insights into various computational social science issues, particularly concerning social influence and information diffusion. However, modeling large-scale social network data comes with computational challenges. Though large language models make it easier than ever to model textual content, any advanced network representation method struggles with scalability and efficient deployment to out-of-sample users. In response, we introduce a novel approach tailored for modeling social network data in user-detection tasks. This innovative method integrates localized social network interactions with the capabilities of large language models. Operating under the premise of social network homophily, which posits that socially connected users share similarities, our approach is designed with scalability and inductive capabilities in mind, avoiding the need for full-graph training. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method across seven real-world social network datasets, spanning a diverse range of topics and detection tasks, showcasing its applicability to advance research in computational social science.",

          "Twitter user profiles contain rich information that allows researchers to infer particular attributes of users' identities. Knowing identity attributes such as gender, age, and/or nationality are a first step in many studies which seek to describe various phenomena related to computational social science. Often, it is through such attributes that studies of social media that focus on, for example, the isolation of foreigners, become possible. However, such characteristics are not often clearly stated by Twitter users, so researchers must turn to other means to ascertain various categories of identity. In this paper, we discuss the challenge of detecting the nationality of Twitter users using rich features from their profiles. In addition, we look at the effectiveness of different features as we go about this task. For the case of a highly diverse country---Qatar---we provide a detailed network analysis with insights into user behaviors and linking preference (or the lack thereof) to other nationalities.",
          "The collective effervescence of social media production has been enjoying a great deal of success in recent years. The hundred of millions of users who are actively participating in the Social Web are exposed to ever-growing amounts of sites, relationships, and information. This work contributes state-of-the-art methods and techniques to the emerging field of Living Analytics , whose main goal is to capture people interactions in real-time and to analyze these data in order to relieve information overload. We introduce intelligent filtering approaches that exploit social interactions, multidimensional relationships, metadata, and other data becoming ubiquitous in the social web, in order to discover and recommend the most relevant and attractive information that meets users' individual needs. In particular, the contributions of this work fall into mainly two categories. (i) Recommender Systems : We present novel algorithms that advance the state-of-the-art in Online Collaborative Filtering. Moreover, we propose an approach based on Swarm Intelligence to directly optimize ranking functions for item recommendations. New approaches to address the cold-start problem in social recommender systems are also part of our contributions. In addition, we also offer a personalized ranking algorithm for Epidemic Intelligence. (ii) Collective Intelligence : Our contributions in the field of computational social science are twofold. First, we explore how social media streams can be exploited for Epidemic Intelligence and show its potential for early warning detection and outbreak analysis and control. Second, we show how the real-time nature of social media streams can be leveraged to take the pulse of political emotions. In total, the methods and studies included in this work constitute an analytics toolbox to help understand and analyze the social web.",
          "We present an in-depth study of co-following on Twitter based on the observation that two Twitter users whose followers have similar friends are also similar, even though they might not share any direct links or a single mutual follower. We show how this observation contributes to (i) a better understanding of language-agnostic user classification on Twitter, (ii) eliciting opportunities for Computational Social Science, and (iii) improving online marketing by identifying cross-selling opportunities. We start with a machine learning problem of predicting a user's preference among two alternative choices of Twitter friends. We show that co-following information provides strong signals for diverse classification tasks and that these signals persist even when the most discriminative features are removed. Going beyond mere classification performance optimization, we present applications of our methodology to Computational Social Science. Here we confirm stereotypes such as that the country singer Kenny Chesney (@kennychesney) is more popular among @GOP followers, whereas Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) enjoys more support from @TheDemocrats followers.",
          "Social divide and polarization have become significant societal issues. To understand the mechanisms behind these phenomena, social media analysis offers research opportunities in computational social science, where developing effective user embedding methods is essential for subsequent analysis. Traditionally, researchers have used predefined network-based user features (e.g., network size, degree, and centrality measures). However, because such measures may not capture the complex characteristics of social media users, in our study we developed a method for embedding users based on a URL domain co-occurrence network. This approach effectively represents social media users involved in competing events such as political campaigns and public health crises. We assessed the method's performance using binary classification tasks and datasets that covered topics associated with the COVID-19 infodemic, such as QAnon, Biden, and Ivermectin, among Twitter users. Our results revealed that user embeddings generated directly from the retweet network and/or based on language performed below expectations, whereas our domain-based embeddings outperformed those methods while reducing computation time. Therefore, domain-based embedding offers an accessible and effective method for characterizing social media users in competing events.",
          "Recent decisions to discontinue access to social media APIs are having detrimental effects on Internet research and the field of computational social science as a whole. This lack of access to data has been dubbed the Post-API era of Internet research. Fortunately, popular search engines have the means to crawl, capture, and surface social media data on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) if provided the proper search query, and may provide a solution to this dilemma. In the present work we ask: does SERP provide a complete and unbiased sample of social media data? Is SERP a viable alternative to direct API-access? To answer these questions, we perform a comparative analysis between (Google) SERP results and nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X. We find that SERP results are highly biased in favor of popular posts; against political, pornographic, and vulgar posts; are more positive in their sentiment; and have large topical gaps. Overall, we conclude that SERP is not a viable alternative to social media API access.",

          "Anonymous news comment data from a news portal in South Korea, naver.com, can help conduct gender research and resolve related issues for sustainable societies. Nevertheless, only a small portion of gender information (i.e., gender distribution) is open to the public, and therefore, it has rarely been considered for gender research. Hence, this paper aims to resolve the matter of incomplete gender information and make the anonymous news comment data usable for gender research as new social media big data. This paper proposes a machine-learning-based approach for predicting the gender distribution (i.e., male and female rates) of anonymous news commenters for a news article. Initially, the big data of news articles and their anonymous news comments were collected and divided into labeled and unlabeled datasets (i.e., with and without gender information). The word2vec approach was employed to represent a news article by the characteristics of the news comments. Then, using the labeled dataset, various prediction techniques were evaluated for predicting the gender distribution of anonymous news commenters for a labeled news article. As a result, the neural network was selected as the best prediction technique, and it could accurately predict the gender distribution of anonymous news commenters of the labeled news article. Thus, this study showed that a machine-learning-based approach can overcome the incomplete gender information problem of anonymous social media users. Moreover, when the gender distributions of the unlabeled news articles were predicted using the best neural network model, trained with the labeled dataset, their distribution turned out different from the labeled news articles. The result indicates that using only the labeled dataset for gender research can result in misleading findings and distorted conclusions. The predicted gender distributions for the unlabeled news articles can help to better understand anonymous news commenters as humans for sustainable societies. Eventually, this study provides a new way for data-driven computational social science with incomplete and anonymous social media big data.",
          "Behavioral web data such as social web activity streams, query logs or behavioral traces from web search and navigation are crucial to understand the temporal evolution of the web and the human interactions that produce web data and models trained on such data.

On the other hand, archiving and using such kind of data is associated with a number of technical and non-technical challenges, e.g. legal and ethical concerns, fast decay of data over time, as well as dependency on 3rd party gatekeepers, such as Twitter/X or Google. We present case studies from many years of research into archiving and temporal analysis of behavioral web data, including large-scale social web archives such as TweetsKB, based on an archive of 14 bn tweets harvested continuously since 2013, and web search and navigation behavior tracked through user studies, longitudinal panels or crowdsourcing-based quasi experiments.",

          "Proprietary public APIs play a crucial and growing role as research tools among social scientists. Among such APIs, Google's machine learning-based Perspective API is extensively utilized for assessing the toxicity of social media messages, providing both an important resource for researchers and automatic content moderation. However, this paper exposes an important bias in Perspective API concerning German language text. Through an in-depth examination of several datasets, we uncover intrinsic language biases within the multilingual model of Perspective API. We find that the toxicity assessment of German content produces significantly higher toxicity levels than other languages. This finding is robust across various translations, topics, and data sources, and has significant consequences for both research and moderation strategies that rely on Perspective API. For instance, we show that, on average, four times more tweets and users would be moderated when using the German language compared to their English translation. Our findings point to broader risks associated with the widespread use of proprietary APIs within the computational social sciences.",
          "Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements, however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites, their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants, we show that these models can access social media content and predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles, which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research purposes.",
          "Short-video platforms show an increasing impact on people's daily lives nowadays, with billions of active users spending plenty of time each day. The interactions between users and online platforms give rise to many scientific problems across computational social science and artificial intelligence. However, despite the rapid development of short-video platforms, currently there are serious shortcomings in existing relevant datasets on three aspects: inadequate user-video feedback, limited user attributes and lack of video content. To address these problems, we provide a large-scale dataset with rich user behavior, attributes and video content from a real mobile short-video platform. This dataset covers 10,000 voluntary users and 153,561 videos, and we conduct four-fold technical validations of the dataset. First, we verify the richness of the behavior and attribute data. Second, we confirm the representing ability of the content features. Third, we provide benchmarking results on recommendation algorithms with our dataset. Finally, we explore the filter bubble phenomenon on the platform using the dataset.

To ensure this privacy, all persistent identifiers are anonymized using salted hash functions, and the raw comment texts are not publicly shared. Instead, we release pre-computed vector representations derived from a state-of-the-art embedding model. The dataset supports research on discussion dynamics, network structures, and semantic analyses in the mid-resourced language German, offering a reusable resource across computational social science and related fields.",
          "This paper aims to analyze longitudinal data, serial data related to different time points, in knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs play a central role for linking different data. While multiple layers for data from different sources are considered, there is only very limited research on longitudinal data in knowledge graphs. However, knowledge graphs are widely used in big data integration, especially for connecting data from different domains. Few studies have investigated the questions how multiple layers and time points within graphs impact methods and algorithms developed for single-purpose networks. This manuscript investigates the impact of a modeling of longitudinal data in multiple layers on retrieval algorithms. In particular, (a) we propose a first draft of a generic model for longitudinal data in multi-layer knowledge graphs, (b) we develop an experimental environment to evaluate a generic retrieval algorithm on random graphs inspired by computational social sciences. We present a knowledge graph generated on German job advertisements comprising data from different sources, both structured and unstructured, on data between 2011 and 2021. The data is linked using text mining and natural language processing methods. We further (c) present two different shrinking techniques for structured and unstructured layers in knowledge based on graph structures like triangles and pseudo-triangles. The presented approach (d) shows that on the one hand, the initial research questions, on the other hand the graph structures and topology have a great impact on the structures and efficiency for additional data stored. Although the experimental analysis of random graphs allows us to make some basic observations we will (e) make suggestions for additional research on particular graph structures that have a great impact on the analysis of knowledge graph structures.",
          "Understanding the sociodemographic composition of online platforms is essential for accurately interpreting digital behavior and its societal implications. Yet, current methods often lack the transparency and reliability required, risking misrepresenting social identities and distorting our understanding of digital society. Here, we introduce a principled framework for sociodemographic inference on Reddit that leverages over 850,000 user self-declarations of age, gender, and partisan affiliation. By training models on sparse user activity signals from this extensive, self-disclosed dataset, we demonstrate that simple probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes, outperform more complex embedding-based alternatives. Our approach improves classification performance over the state of the art by up to 19% in ROC AUC and maintains quantification error below 15%. The models produce well-calibrated and interpretable outputs, enabling uncertainty estimation and subreddit-level feature importance analysis. More broadly, this work advocates for a shift toward more ethical and transparent computational social science by grounding sociodemographic analysis in user-provided data rather than researcher assumptions.",
          "Abstract Predicting the evolution of dynamic social networks is a fundamental challenge in computational social science. Traditional methods that rely on network structure or surface level textual features often fail to capture the latent ideological drivers governing user interactions. In this paper, we propose that the formation of future social ties is primarily driven by alignment with evolving narrative frames rather than simple textual similarity. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel framework for frame-attentive dynamic link prediction. First, we develop an LLM driven pipeline that integrates hierarchical community detection with bottom up abstractive summarization to induce structured semantic frames from unstructured user discourse. Second, we construct a dual layer heterogeneous graph that explicitly models both social structure (user-user interactions) and ideological alignment (user-frame connections). Finally, we propose a frame-attentive graph representation learning mechanism to generate user embeddings that are grounded in this socio-semantic context. Extensive experiments on two large scale geopolitics datasets from Weibo and X (Twitter) demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our model significantly outperforms a wide range of strong baselines, achieving up to a 33.5% improvement in AUC-ROC and an 89% Precision@100. Ablation studies and temporal analyses further confirm that the LLM-induced frames provide a more robust and predictive signal for social dynamics than conventional features. This work provides strong empirical evidence for the narrative resonance hypothesis and offers a powerful new paradigm for modeling the evolution of online social networks.",
          "With ever-increasing available data, predicting individuals' preferences and helping them locate the most relevant information has become a pressing need. Understanding and predicting preferences is also important from a fundamental point of view, as part of what has been called a \"new\" computational social science. Here, we propose a novel approach based on stochastic block models, which have been developed by sociologists as plausible models of complex networks of social interactions. Our model is in the spirit of predicting individuals' preferences based on the preferences of others but, rather than fitting a particular model, we rely on a Bayesian approach that samples over the ensemble of all possible models. We show that our approach is considerably more accurate than leading recommender algorithms, with major relative improvements between 38% and 99% over industry-level algorithms. Besides, our approach sheds light on decision-making processes by identifying groups of individuals that have consistently similar preferences, and enabling the analysis of the characteristics of those groups.",
          "Proprietary public APIs play a crucial and growing role as research tools among social scientists. Among such APIs, Google's machine learning-based Perspective API is extensively utilized for assessing the toxicity of social media messages, providing both an important resource for researchers and automatic content moderation. However, this paper exposes an important bias in Perspective API concerning German language text. Through an in-depth examination of several datasets, we uncover intrinsic language biases within the multilingual model of Perspective API. We find that the toxicity assessment of German content produces significantly higher toxicity levels than other languages. This finding is robust across various translations, topics, and data sources, and has significant consequences for both research and moderation strategies that rely on Perspective API. For instance, we show that, on average, four times more tweets and users would be moderated when using the German language compared to their English translation. Our findings point to broader risks associated with the widespread use of proprietary APIs within the computational social sciences.",
          "Studies in computational social science often require collecting data about users via a search engine interface: a list of keywords is provided as a query to the interface and documents matching this query are returned. The validity of a study will hence critically depend on the representativeness of the data returned by the search engine. In this paper, we develop a multi-objective approach to build queries yielding documents that are both relevant to the study and representative of the larger population of documents. We then specify measures to evaluate the relevance and the representativeness of documents retrieved by a query system. Using these measures, we experiment on three real-world datasets and show that our method outperforms baselines commonly used to solve this data collection problem.",
          "In this research, we evaluate four widely used face detection tools, which are Face++, IBM Bluemix Visual Recognition, AWS Rekognition, and Microsoft Azure Face API, using multiple datasets to determine their accuracy in inferring user attributes, including gender, race, and age. Results show that the tools are generally proficient at determining gender, with accuracy rates greater than 90%, except for IBM Bluemix. Concerning race, only one of the four tools provides this capability, Face++, with an accuracy rate of greater than 90%, although the evaluation was performed on a high-quality dataset. Inferring age appears to be a challenging problem, as all four tools performed poorly. The findings of our quantitative evaluation are helpful for future computational social science research using these tools, as their accuracy needs to be taken into account when applied to classifying individuals on social media and other contexts. Triangulation and manual verification are suggested for researchers employing these tools.",
          "The proliferation of social network data has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for extensive, data-driven exploration of human behavior. The structural intricacies of social networks offer insights into various computational social science issues, particularly concerning social influence and information diffusion. However, modeling large-scale social network data comes with computational challenges. Though large language models make it easier than ever to model textual content, any advanced network representation methods struggle with scalability and efficient deployment to out-of-sample users. In response, we introduce a novel approach tailored for modeling social network data in user detection tasks. This innovative method integrates localized social network interactions with the capabilities of large language models. Operating under the premise of social network homophily, which posits that socially connected users share similarities, our approach is designed to address these challenges. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our method across seven real-world social network datasets, spanning a diverse range of topics and detection tasks, showcasing its applicability to advance research in computational social science.",
          "Demographically-tagged social media messages are a common source of data for computational social science. While these messages can indicate differences in beliefs and behaviors between demographic groups, we do not have a clear understanding of how different demographic groups use platforms such as Twitter. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of how groups' differing behaviors may confound analyses of the groups themselves. We analyzed one million Twitter users by first inferring demographic attributes, and then measuring several indicators of Twitter behavior. We find differences in these indicators across demographic groups, suggesting that there may be underlying differences in how different demographic groups use Twitter.",
          "We present an in-depth study of co-following on Twitter based on the observation that two Twitter users whose followers have similar friends are also similar, even though they might not share any direct links or a single mutual follower. We show how this observation contributes to (i) a better understanding of language-agnostic user classification on Twitter, (ii) eliciting opportunities for Computational Social Science, and (iii) improving online marketing by identifying cross-selling opportunities. We start with a machine learning problem of predicting a user's preference among two alternative choices of Twitter friends. We show that co-following information provides strong signals for diverse classification tasks and that these signals persist even when (i) the most discriminative features are removed and (ii) only relatively \"sparse\" users with fewer than 152 but more than 43 Twitter friends are considered. Going beyond mere classification performance optimization, we present applications of our methodology to Computational Social Science. Here we confirm stereotypes such as that the country singer Kenny Chesney (@kennychesney) is more popular among @GOP followers, whereas Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) enjoys more support from @TheDemocrats followers. In the domain of marketing we give evidence that celebrity endorsement is reflected in co-following and we demonstrate how our methodology can be used to reveal the audience similarities between Apple and Puma and, less obviously, between Nike and Coca-Cola. Concerning a user's popularity we find a statistically significant connection between having a more \"average\" followership and having more followers than direct rivals. Interestingly, a \\emph{larger} audience also seems to be linked to a \\emph{less diverse} audience in terms of their co-following.",

          "Recent decisions to discontinue access to social media APIs are having detrimental effects on Internet research and the field of computational social science as a whole. This lack of access to data has been dubbed the Post-API era of Internet research. Fortunately, popular search engines have the means to crawl, capture, and surface social media data on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) if provided the proper search query, and may provide a solution to this dilemma. In the present work we ask: does SERP provide a complete and unbiased sample of social media data? Is SERP a viable alternative to direct API-access? To answer these questions, we perform a comparative analysis between (Google) SERP results and nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X. We find that SERP results are highly biased in favor of popular posts; against political, pornographic, and vulgar posts; are more positive in their sentiment; and have large topical gaps. Overall, we conclude that SERP is not a viable alternative to social media API access.",
          "The proliferation of user-generated content on online platforms like Reddit has created vast datasets that can be used to extract significant knowledge, such as author attribution through various analytical techniques. Author attribution is the task of identifying the writer of a given text, or in this case, comments or posts. This analysis can help us understand how people interact on Reddit, and it could also be useful for detecting issues such as fake accounts, secondary accounts, or just getting a better sense of how individual users behave. Namely, author verification and author attributions help us identify if two or more accounts are from the same person or genuinely from different people. However, the challenge is that figuring out this information from short and casual posts like you often see on Reddit is not straightforward. The brevity usually leads to sparse feature representations, and informal language can obscure consistent stylistic patterns that are readily apparent in longer, more formal writing. Existing author attribution methods may not be optimally suited for capturing the subtle yet distinctive linguistic cues that differentiate authors within the specific context of Reddit’s or similar platforms’ communication style. This research addresses the challenge of author attribution in Reddit comments by employing a comprehensive feature engineering strategy coupled with the evaluation of several machine learning and deep learning models. Our hypothesis is that, by looking at different language details, especially stylometric details that are typical of Reddit posts, we can figure out if two comments were written by the same person. Our literature survey suggested that stylometry analysis is more relevant for author attribution or verification. To assess the effectiveness of these engineered features, we evaluate the performance of three distinct classification models: a decision tree, a random forest, and a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In bidirectional LSTM, we use two different inputs and see the performance. The outcomes of this research hold significant implications for various stakeholders. Researchers in natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science can leverage our feature engineering pipeline and the comparative model analysis as a benchmark and a source of inspiration for future work on author attribution in online contexts. Furthermore, understanding the linguistic markers that characterize individual authors on platforms like Reddit can inform sociolinguistic studies and the evolution of online communication. Ultimately, this work aims to advance the state-of-the-art author attribution for short, informal text data, providing practical tools and valuable insights for a range of applications.",
          "Computational Social Science (CSS), aiming at utilizing computational methods to address social science problems, is a recent emerging and fast-developing field. The study of CSS is data-driven and significantly benefits from the availability of online user-generated contents and social networks, which contain rich text and network data for investigation. However, these large-scale and multi-modal data also present researchers with a great challenge: how to represent data effectively to mine the meanings we want in CSS? To explore the answer, we give a thorough review of data representations in CSS for both text and network. Specifically, we summarize existing representations into two schemes, namely symbol-based and embedding-based representations, and introduce a series of typical methods for each scheme. Afterwards, we present the applications of the above representations based on the investigation of more than 400 research articles from 6 top venues involved with CSS. From the statistics of these applications, we unearth the strength of each kind of representations and discover the tendency that embedding-based representations are emerging and obtaining increasing attention over the last decade. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and open issues for future directions. This survey aims to provide a deeper understanding and more advisable applications of data representations for CSS researchers."

Here, we tackle a pervasive problem in synthetic data generation: its generative distribution often differs from the distribution of real-world data researchers care about (in other words, it is unfaithful). In a case study on sarcasm detection, we study three strategies to increase the faithfulness of synthetic data: grounding, filtering, and taxonomy-based generation. We evaluate these strategies using the performance of classifiers trained with generated synthetic data on real-world data. While all three strategies improve the performance of classifiers, we find that grounding works best for the task at hand. As synthetic data generation plays an ever-increasing role in NLP research, we expect this work to be a stepping stone in improving its utility. We conclude this paper with some recommendations on how to generate high(er)-fidelity synthetic data for specific tasks.",

Due to the increased amount of text data there is a growing number of use-cases where the initial effort of human classifiers was successfully augmented using supervised machine learning (SML). In this paper, we investigate such a hybrid workflow solution classifying the lead paragraphs of New York Times front-page articles from 1996 to 2006 according to policy topic categories (such education or defense) of the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP). The SML classification is conducted in multiple rounds, and within each round, we run the SML algorithm on n samples and n times if the given algorithm is non-deterministic (e.g., SVM). If all the SML predictions point towards a single label for a document, then it is classified as such (this approach is also called a “voting ensemble\"). In the second step, we explore several scenarios, ranging from using the SML ensemble without human validation to incorporating active learning. Using these scenarios, we can quantify the gains from the various workflow versions. We find that using human coding and validation combined with an ensemble SML hybrid approach can reduce the need for human coding while maintaining very high precision rates and offering a modest to a good level of recall.

Clear and comprehensive validation is crucial, enabling readers to critically evaluate both the methodology and the resulting measure.

          "Manually annotating data for computational social science tasks can be costly, time-consuming, and emotionally draining. While recent work suggests that LLMs can perform such annotation tasks in zero-shot settings, little is known about how prompt design impacts LLMs' compliance and accuracy. We conduct a large-scale multi-prompt experiment to test how model selection (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and Falcon7b) and prompt design features (definition inclusion, output type, explanation, and prompt length) impact the compliance and accuracy of LLM-generated annotations on four highly relevant and diverse CSS tasks (toxicity, sentiment, rumor stance, and news frames). Our results show that LLM compliance and accuracy are prompt-dependent. For instance, prompting for numerical scores instead of labels reduces all LLMs' compliance and accuracy. Concise prompts can significantly reduce prompting costs but also lead to lower accuracy on tasks like toxicity. Furthermore, minor prompt changes like asking for an explanation can cause large changes in the distribution of LLM-generated labels. By assessing the impact of prompt design on the quality and distribution of LLM-generated annotations, this work serves as both a practical guide and a warning for using LLMs in CSS research.",
          "Computational social science lacks a scalable and reliable mechanism to assure quality for AI-assisted qualitative coding when tasks demand domain expertise and long-text reasoning, and traditional double-coding is prohibitively costly at scale. We develop and validate a dual-signal quality assessment framework that combines model confidence with inter-model consensus (external entropy) and evaluate it across legal reasoning (390 Supreme Court cases), political analysis (645 hyperpartisan articles), and medical classification (1,000 clinical transcripts). External entropy is consistently negatively associated with accuracy (r = -0.179 to -0.273, p &lt; 0.001), while confidence is positively associated in two domains (r = 0.104 to 0.429). Weight optimization improves over single-signal baselines by 6.6-113.7% and transfers across domains (100% success), and an intelligent triage protocol reduces manual verification effort by 44.6% while maintaining quality. The framework offers a principled, domain-agnostic quality assurance mechanism that scales qualitative coding without extensive double-coding, provides actionable guidance for sampling and verification, and enables larger and more diverse corpora to be analyzed with maintained rigor.",
          "A growing body of literature has examined the potential of machine learning algorithms in constructing social indicators based on the automatic classification of digital traces. However, as long as the classification algorithms&#x2019; predictions are not completely error-free, the estimate of the relative occurrence of a particular class may be affected by misclassification bias, thereby affecting the value of the calculated social indicator. Although a significant amount of studies have investigated misclassification bias correction techniques, they commonly rely on a set of assumptions that are likely to be violated in practice, which calls into question the effectiveness of these methods. Thus, there is a knowledge gap with respect to the assessment of misclassification bias&#x2019;s impact on a specific social indicator formula without strict reference to the number of classes. Moreover, given the erroneous nature of automatic classification algorithms, the quality of a predicted indicator can be assessed not only using regression quality metrics, as was done in existing literature, but also using correlation metrics. In this paper, we propose a simulation approach for assessing the impact of misclassification bias on the calculated social indicators in terms of regression and correlation metrics. The proposed approach focuses on indicators calculated based on the distribution of classes and can process any number of classes. The proposed approach allows selecting the most appropriate classification model for a particular social indicator, and vice versa. Moreover, it allows for assessment of the optimistic level of correlation between the indicator calculated based on the results of the classification algorithm and the true underlying indicator.",

          "In computational social science (CSS), researchers analyze documents to explain social and political phenomena. In most scenarios, CSS researchers first obtain labels for documents and then explain labels using interpretable regression analyses in the second step. One increasingly common way to annotate documents cheaply at scale is through large language models (LLMs). However, like other scalable ways of producing annotations, such surrogate labels are often imperfect and biased. We present a new algorithm for using imperfect annotation surrogates for downstream statistical analyses while guaranteeing statistical properties -- like asymptotic unbiasedness and proper uncertainty quantification -- which are fundamental to CSS research. We show that direct use of surrogate labels in downstream statistical analyses leads to substantial bias and invalid confidence intervals, even with high surrogate accuracy of 80-90%. To address this, we build on debiased machine learning to propose the design-based supervised learning (DSL) estimator. DSL employs a doubly-robust procedure to combine surrogate labels with a smaller number of high-quality, gold-standard labels. Our approach guarantees valid inference for downstream statistical analyses, even when surrogates are arbitrarily biased and without requiring stringent assumptions, by controlling the probability of sampling documents for gold-standard labeling. Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that DSL provides valid statistical inference while achieving root mean squared errors comparable to existing alternatives that focus only on prediction without inferential guarantees.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the Computational Social Science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers' gold references. We conclude that the performance of today's LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans.",

The dataset includes over 1,600 English sentence--target pairs annotated along three dimensions: trust and sociability (components of warmth), and competence. The sentences in W&C-Sent are from social media and often express attitudes and opinions about specific individuals or social groups (the targets of our annotations). We describe the data collection, annotation, and quality-control procedures in detail, and evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) on their ability to identify trust, sociability, and competence in text. W&C-Sent provides a new resource for analyzing warmth and competence in language and supports future research at the intersection of NLP and computational social science.",
          "Large language models (LLMs) have shown high agreement with human raters across a variety of tasks, demonstrating potential to ease the challenges of human data collection. In computational social science (CSS), researchers are increasingly leveraging LLM annotations to complement slow and expensive human annotations. Still, guidelines for collecting and using LLM annotations, without compromising the validity of downstream conclusions, remain limited. We introduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations and LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations should be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates and provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human annotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations of poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no less accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical estimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and bias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each. Although we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can be used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP problems.",
          "Computational social science (CSS) practitioners often rely on human-labeled data to fine-tune supervised text classifiers. We assess the potential for researchers to augment or replace human-generated training data with surrogate training labels from generative large language models (LLMs). We introduce a recommended workflow and test this LLM application by replicating 14 classification tasks and measuring performance. We employ a novel corpus of English-language text classification data sets from recent CSS articles in high-impact journals. Because these data sets are stored in password-protected archives, our analyses are less prone to issues of contamination. For each task, we compare supervised classifiers fine-tuned using GPT-4 labels against classifiers fine-tuned with human annotations and against labels from GPT-4 and Mistral-7B with few-shot in-context learning. Our findings indicate that supervised classification models fine-tuned on LLM-generated labels perform comparably to models fine-tuned with labels from human annotators. Fine-tuning models using LLM-generated labels can be a fast, efficient and cost-effective method of building supervised text classifiers.",
          "Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.",
          "Predictions and generations from large language models are increasingly being explored as an aid in limited data regimes, such as in computational social science and human subjects research. While prior technical work has mainly explored the potential to use model-predicted labels for unlabeled data in a principled manner, there is increasing interest in using large language models to generate entirely new synthetic samples (e.g., synthetic simulations), such as in responses to surveys. However, it remains unclear by what means practitioners can combine such data with real data and yet produce statistically valid conclusions upon them. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator based on generalized method of moments, providing a hyperparameter-free solution with strong theoretical guarantees to address this challenge. Intriguingly, we find that interactions between the moment residuals of synthetic data and those of real data (i.e., when they are predictive of each other) can greatly improve estimates of the target parameter. We validate the finite-sample performance of our estimator across different tasks in computational social science applications, demonstrating large empirical gains.",

In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the promises and risks associated with using LLMs for text classification tasks, using social movement studies as an example. We propose a framework for social scientists to incorporate LLMs into text annotation, either as the primary coding decision-maker or as a coding assistant. This framework offers researchers tools to develop the potential best-performing prompt, and to systematically examine and report the validity and reliability of LLMs as a methodological tool. Additionally, we evaluate and discuss its epistemic risks associated with validity, reliability, replicability, and transparency. We conclude with several practical guidelines for using LLMs in text annotation tasks and offer recommendations for more effectively communicating epistemic risks in research.",
          "We prove the equivalence of first-order lo-cal consistency relaxations and the MAX SAT relaxation of Goemans and Williamson (1994) for a class of MRFs we refer to as logi-cal MRFs. This allows us to combine the ad-vantages of each into a single MAP inference technique: solving the local consistency re-laxation with any of a number of highly scal-able message-passing algorithms, and then obtaining a high-quality discrete solution via a guaranteed rounding procedure when the relaxation is not tight. Logical MRFs are a general class of models that can incorpo-rate many common dependencies, such as logical implications and mixtures of super-modular and submodular potentials. They can be used for many structured prediction tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and computational social science. We show that our new inference technique can improve solution quality by as much as 20 % without sacrificing speed on problems with over one million dependencies. 1",
          "Generative large language models (LLMs) are now used extensively for text classification in computational social science (CSS). In this work, focus on the steps before and after LLM prompting -- conceptualization of concepts to be classified and using LLM predictions in downstream statistical inference -- which we argue have been overlooked in much of LLM-era CSS. We claim LLMs can tempt analysts to skip the conceptualization step, creating conceptualization errors that bias downstream estimates. Using simulations, we show that this conceptualization-induced bias cannot be corrected for solely by increasing LLM accuracy or post-hoc bias correction methods. We conclude by reminding CSS analysts that conceptualization is still a first-order concern in the LLM-era and provide concrete advice on how to pursue low-cost, unbiased, low-variance downstream estimates.",

          "Real-world applications of large language models (LLMs) in computational social science (CSS) tasks primarily depend on the effectiveness of instruction tuning (IT) or in-context learning (ICL). While IT has shown highly effective at fine-tuning LLMs for various tasks, ICL offers a rapid alternative for task adaptation by learning from examples without explicit gradient updates. In this paper, we evaluate the classification performance of LLMs using IT versus ICL in few-shot CSS tasks. The experimental results indicate that ICL consistently outperforms IT in most CSS tasks. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between the increasing number of training samples and LLM performance. Our findings show that simply increasing the number of samples without considering their quality does not consistently enhance the performance of LLMs with either ICL or IT and can sometimes even result in a performance decline. Finally, we compare three prompting strategies, demonstrating that ICL is more effective than zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Our research highlights the significant advantages of ICL in handling CSS tasks in few-shot settings and emphasizes the importance of optimizing sample quality and prompting strategies to improve LLM classification performance. The code will be made available.",

In this study, we evaluate five uncertainty quantification (UQ) strategies across three CSS classification problems: stance detection, ideology identification, and frame detection. We benchmark these strategies using three different LLMs. To enhance human-in-the-loop classification performance, we introduce an ensemble-based UQ aggregation method, C_ensemble, and propose a novel evaluation metric, Misclassified Recall, designed to better assess model uncertainty on mislabeled or ambiguous data points. Our results show that C_ensemble outperforms existing UQ techniques in six out of nine model-dataset combinations, achieving an average AUC improvement of 8.7%. These findings highlight the potential of UQ-driven methods to significantly improve the reliability and efficiency of human-in-the-loop data annotation pipelines.",
          "Many tasks related to Computational Social Science and Web Content Analysis involve classifying pieces of text based on the claims they contain. State-of-the-art approaches usually involve fine-tuning models on large annotated datasets, which are costly to produce. In light of this, we propose and release a qualitative and versatile few-shot learning methodology as a common paradigm for any claim-based textual classification task. This methodology involves defining the classes as arbitrarily sophisticated taxonomies of claims, and using Natural Language Inference models to obtain the textual entailment between these and a corpus of interest. The performance of these models is then boosted by annotating a minimal sample of data points, dynamically sampled using the well-established statistical heuristic of Probabilistic Bisection. We illustrate this methodology in the context of three tasks: climate change contrarianism detection, topic/stance classification and depression-relates symptoms detection. This approach rivals traditional pre-train/fine-tune approaches while drastically reducing the need for data annotation.",
          "Many scientific fields -- including biology, health, education, and the social sciences -- use machine learning (ML) to help them analyze data at an unprecedented scale. However, ML researchers who develop advanced methods rarely provide detailed tutorials showing how to apply these methods. Existing tutorials are often costly to participants, presume extensive programming knowledge, and are not tailored to specific application fields. In an attempt to democratize ML methods, we organized a year-long, free, online tutorial series targeted at teaching advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to computational social science (CSS) scholars. Two organizers worked with fifteen subject matter experts to develop one-hour presentations with hands-on Python code for a range of ML methods and use cases, from data pre-processing to analyzing temporal variation of language change. Although live participation was more limited than expected, a comparison of pre- and post-tutorial surveys showed an increase in participants' perceived knowledge of almost one point on a 7-point Likert scale. Furthermore, participants asked thoughtful questions during tutorials and engaged readily with tutorial content afterwards, as demonstrated by 10K~total views of posted tutorial recordings. In this report, we summarize our organizational efforts and distill five principles for democratizing ML+X tutorials. We hope future organizers improve upon these principles and continue to lower barriers to developing ML skills for researchers of all fields.",
          "Automated text annotation is a compelling use case for generative large language models (LLMs) in social media research. Recent work suggests that LLMs can achieve strong performance on annotation tasks; however, these studies evaluate LLMs on a small number of tasks and likely suffer from contamination due to a reliance on public benchmark datasets. Here, we test a human-centered framework for responsibly evaluating artificial intelligence tools used in automated annotation. We use GPT-4 to replicate 27 annotation tasks across 11 password-protected datasets from recently published computational social science articles in high-impact journals. For each task, we compare GPT-4 annotations against human-annotated ground-truth labels and against annotations from separate supervised classification models fine-tuned on human-generated labels. Although the quality of LLM labels is generally high, we find significant variation in LLM performance across tasks, even within datasets. Our findings underscore the importance of a human-centered workflow and careful evaluation standards: Automated annotations significantly diverge from human judgment in numerous scenarios, despite various optimization strategies such as prompt tuning. Grounding automated annotation in validation labels generated by humans is essential for responsible evaluation.",
          "In computational social science, researchers often use a pre-trained, black box classifier to estimate the frequency of each class in unlabeled datasets. A variety of prevalence estimation techniques have been developed in the literature, each yielding an unbiased estimate if certain stability assumption holds. This work introduces a framework to rethink the prevalence estimation process as calibrating the classifier outputs against ground truth labels to obtain the joint distribution of a base dataset and then extrapolating to the joint distribution of a target dataset. We call this framework \"Calibrate-Extrapolate\". It clarifies what stability assumptions must hold for a prevalence estimation technique to yield accurate estimates. In the calibration phase, the techniques assume only a stable calibration curve between a calibration dataset and the full base dataset. This allows for the classifier outputs to be used for disproportionate random sampling, thus improving the efficiency of calibration. In the extrapolation phase, some techniques assume a stable calibration curve while some assume stable class-conditional densities. We discuss the stability assumptions from a causal perspective. By specifying base and target joint distributions, we can generate simulated datasets, as a way to build intuitions about the impacts of assumption violations. This also leads to a better understanding of how the classifier's predictive power affects the accuracy of prevalence estimates: the greater the predictive power, the lower the sensitivity to violations of stability assumptions in the extrapolation phase. We illustrate the framework with an application that estimates the prevalence of toxic comments on news topics over time on Reddit, Twitter/X, and YouTube, using Jigsaw's Perspective API as a black box classifier. Finally, we summarize several practical advice for prevalence estimation.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have recently demonstrated remarkable potential in social science research through their capacity to efficiently perform a wide range of text-as-data tasks. However, current applied social science research which relies on these models tend to use closed-source models and zero-shot learning. This study contrasts the performance of state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with their open-source counterparts across 10 multi-class classification tasks critical to social science research, such as emotion detection and political speech classification. In addition, we introduce dynamic few-shot learning, an enhancement to static few-shot learning, that leverages semantic similarity to dynamically choose contextually relevant examples from a pre-defined corpus for improved prompt engineering. Our research indicates that dynamic few-shot learning significantly boosts classification performance, especially for much smaller models. Our findings help expand the methodological toolbox for social scientists and suggest more transparent, ethical, and efficient ways of leveraging the power of LLMs in social science research.",
          "Manually annotating data for computational social science tasks can be costly, time-consuming, and emotionally draining. While recent work suggests that LLMs can perform such annotation tasks in zero-shot settings, little is known about how prompt design impacts LLMs' compliance and accuracy. We conduct a large-scale multi-prompt experiment to test how model selection (ChatGPT, PaLM2, and Falcon7b) and prompt design features (definition inclusion, output type, explanation, and prompt length) impact the compliance and accuracy of LLM-generated annotations on four CSS tasks (toxicity, sentiment, rumor stance, and news frames). Our results show that LLM compliance and accuracy are highly prompt-dependent. For instance, prompting for numerical scores instead of labels reduces all LLMs' compliance and accuracy. The overall best prompting setup is task-dependent, and minor prompt changes can cause large changes in the distribution of generated labels. By showing that prompt design significantly impacts the quality and distribution of LLM-generated annotations, this work serves as both a warning and practical guide for researchers and practitioners.",

          "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive language understanding and the capacity to generate responses that follow specific prompts. However, due to the computational demands associated with training these models, their applications often adopt a zero-shot setting. In this paper, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of two publicly accessible LLMs, ChatGPT and OpenAssistant, in the context of six Computational Social Science classification tasks, while also investigating the effects of various prompting strategies. Our experiments investigate the impact of prompt complexity, including the effect of incorporating label definitions into the prompt; use of synonyms for label names; and the influence of integrating past memories during foundation model training. The findings indicate that in a zero-shot setting, current LLMs are unable to match the performance of smaller, fine-tuned baseline transformer models (such as BERT-large). Additionally, we find that different prompting strategies can significantly affect classification accuracy, with variations in accuracy and F1 scores exceeding 10\\%.",
          "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into computational social science research, yet their blackboxed training and designed stochastic elements in inference pose unique challenges for scientific inquiry. This article argues that applying LLMs to social scientific tasks requires explicit assessment of uncertainty-an expectation long established in both quantitative methodology in the social sciences and machine learning. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating LLM uncertainty along two dimensions: the task type (T), which distinguishes between classification, short-form, and long-form generation, and the validation type (V), which captures the availability of reference data or evaluative criteria. Drawing from both computer science and social science literature, we map existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods to this T-V typology and offer practical recommendations for researchers. Our framework provides both a methodological safeguard and a practical guide for integrating LLMs into rigorous social science research.",
          "Computational social science lacks a scalable and reliable mechanism to assure quality for AI-assisted qualitative coding when tasks demand domain expertise and long-text reasoning, and traditional double-coding is prohibitively costly at scale. We develop and validate a dual-signal quality assessment framework that combines model confidence with inter-model consensus (external entropy) and evaluate it across legal reasoning (390 Supreme Court cases), political analysis (645 hyperpartisan articles), and medical classification (1,000 clinical transcripts). External entropy is consistently negatively associated with accuracy (r = -0.179 to -0.273, p &lt; 0.001), while confidence is positively associated in two domains (r = 0.104 to 0.429). Weight optimization improves over single-signal baselines by 6.6-113.7% and transfers across domains (100% success), and an intelligent triage protocol reduces manual verification effort by 44.6% while maintaining quality. The framework offers a principled, domain-agnostic quality assurance mechanism that scales qualitative coding without extensive double-coding, provides actionable guidance for sampling and verification, and enables larger and more diverse corpora to be analyzed with maintained rigor.",

          "Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans.",

          "Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech is not just \"simple\" or \"complex,\" but exists on a continuum between extremes. Scalar measurement of text---or text scoring---is thus a central problem for computational social science and text-as-data applications. Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive measurement tool, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical output complicates their application in text scoring, raising questions of how to best use these tools for scalar measurement. This paper addresses these questions by conducting a comprehensive study of text scoring with LLMs for various complex social science constructs. We compare finetuned and prompted models in a variety of configurations, evaluating with multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature. Our study yields actionable findings for applied researchers: LLMs prompted to score texts directly can yield discontinuous distributions over scales; adjusting their response through token-probability weighting can mitigate this problem; adjusted LLM scores align moderately to strongly with human ground-truth; finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.",

To bring clarity on the values of different strategies, we present an overview of the performance of modern LLM-based classification methods on a benchmark of 23 social knowledge tasks. Our results point to three best practices: select models with larger vocabulary and pre-training corpora; avoid simple zero-shot in favor of AI-enhanced prompting; fine-tune on task-specific data, and consider more complex forms instruction-tuning on multiple datasets only when only training data is more abundant.",

We explore the use of LLMs for supervised text classification, specifically the application to stance detection, which involves detecting attitudes and opinions in texts. We examine the performance of these models across different architectures, training regimes, and task specifications. We compare 10 models ranging in size from tens of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters and test four distinct training regimes: Prompt-based zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, fine-tuning, and instruction-tuning, which combines prompting and fine-tuning. The largest, most powerful models generally offer the best predictive performance even with little or no training examples, but fine-tuning smaller models is a competitive solution due to their relatively high accuracy and low cost. Instruction-tuning the latest generative LLMs expands the scope of text classification, enabling applications to more complex tasks than previously feasible. We offer practical recommendations on the use of LLMs for text classification in sociological research and discuss their limitations and challenges. Ultimately, LLMs can make text classification and other text analysis methods more accurate, accessible, and adaptable, opening new possibilities for computational social science.",

          "Abstract The generation and spread of fake news within new and online media sources is emerging as a phenomenon of high societal significance. Combating them using data-driven analytics has been attracting much recent scholarly interest. In this computational social science study, we analyze the textual coherence of fake news articles vis-a-vis legitimate ones. We develop three computational formulations of textual coherence drawing upon the state-of-the-art methods in natural language processing and data science. Two real-world datasets from widely different domains which have fake/legitimate article labellings are then analyzed with respect to textual coherence. We observe apparent differences in textual coherence across fake and legitimate news articles, with fake news articles consistently scoring lower on coherence as compared to legitimate news ones. While the relative coherence shortfall of fake news articles as compared to legitimate ones form the main observation from our study, we analyze several aspects of the differences and outline potential avenues of further inquiry.",
          "We provide a filtered, pre-processed and anonymized dataset collected originally from the Twitter decahose (a random 10% sample of Twitter) over 29 days in October, 2016, to support computational social science research on how people on Twitter use emojis. The data comprises of a table with four columns and 4,057,872 rows (including a header). The fields of the table are: ID: A unique tweet ID that could also be used to ‘hydrate’ the contents of the tweet directly from Twitter. Country: The country code associated with the tweet. Language: The language metadata tag associated with the tweet. We only retain the top 30 languages (sorted by frequency of tweets) in our initial corpus. Emojis: The emojis extracted from the ‘text’ field of the tweet. The methodology that was used to extract the tweets is described in the next section.

          "The growth of online platforms has amplified the spread of conspiracy theories, presenting a significant challenge to social cohesion and online safety. While platforms like Twitter and Facebook have received considerable academic attention, the unique ecosystem of YouTube comments remains comparatively underexplored as a site of conspiratorial discourse. This dissertation addresses this gap by presenting a systematic investigation into the detection of conspiratorial narratives within YouTube comments using a comparative evaluation of artificial intelligence techniques. This dissertation presents and validates a multiphase methodological framework through a systematic empirical investigation. The research first conducts an exploratory discourse analysis of a prominent case study, the 2023 Maui wildfires, to identify the distinct linguistic, emotional and topical signatures of conspiratorial content. Building on these findings, a novel dataset of over 7,300 YouTube comments is manually annotated. The core of the study is a rigorous comparative evaluation of three tiers of AI detection methods: (1) traditional machine learning models (e.g., SVM, XGBoost) using engineered text and psycholinguistic features; (2) fine-tuned Transformer models (BERT, BERTweet); and (3) zero-shot classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). The results reveal a clear hierarchy of performance, with LLMs demonstrating superior accuracy, achieving a top F1-score of 0.880. Notably, a hybrid approach combining Google’s foundation model embeddings with an XGBoost classifier also performed exceptionally well, outperforming the fine-tuned Transformer models. A key finding is that the explicit addition of sentiment and emotion features did not consistently improve model performance. This suggests that the rich, high-dimensional embeddings from modern foundation models already implicitly encode these psycholinguistic signals, rendering separate feature engineering mostly redundant. This research concludes that the effective detection of nuanced, narrative-driven phenomena like conspiracy theories is increasingly dependent on deep semantic understanding rather than surface-level linguistic markers. The findings hold significant implications for both computational social science and practical content moderation,advocating for a shift towards leveraging foundation models and suggesting a prag�matic, structured approach for developing scalable moderation systems.

          "Social media has profoundly transformed society. However, the proliferation of harmful content - such as hate speech, misinformation, and conspiracy theories - challenges platform integrity and poses a significant threat to society. Enhancing the integrity of social media is thus of utmost importance. In this dissertation, we propose a computational approach to improve the integrity of social media along three key dimensions: (1) the detection and understanding of harmful content, (2) audits of social media platforms, and (3) interventions to counter abusive behavior. To achieve this, we combine state-of-the-art methods from computer science with insights from the social sciences and explore each dimension through distinct case studies in three parts. The first part focuses on detecting and understanding harmful content. Specifically, we employ a machine learning approach to identify QAnon conspiracy theorists on Parler and profile their characteristics compared to other users. We then statistically analyze the diffusion dynamics of online rumors to gain deeper insights into how harmful content spreads on social media. The second part shifts attention to auditing social media platforms. Here, we examine how proprietary algorithms, often beyond societal control, can perpetuate biases. As a case study, we analyze the delivery of political ads on Meta during the 2021 German Federal Election. The third part explores interventions aimed at countering harmful content and fostering civil behavior on social media. This includes results from a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment evaluating the effectiveness of AI-generated counterspeech, employing large language models, in reducing online hate speech. By combining computational methodologies with interdisciplinary perspectives, this dissertation advances the understanding of social media vulnerabilities and delivers actionable solutions for cultivating safer digital environments. Scientifically, it demonstrates the practical application of machine learning, natural language processing, and social media analytics in detecting harmful content, auditing opaque algorithms, and evaluating scalable interventions. These contributions extend computational social science literature and inform strategies for algorithmic accountability and fair content delivery. On a societal level, the results emphasize the importance of transparency in social media platforms and highlight both the potential and risks of automated interventions, such as AI-generated counterspeech, in curbing online harms. Overall, this dissertation provides a roadmap for platform providers and policymakers committed to promoting equity, inclusivity, and democratic values within social media ecosystems.",
          "Machine learning has made slow inroads into quantitative social science due to both a mismatch of machine learning's strengths to the causal and inferential tasks domain researchers pursue [1] and also a lack of algorithmic training among many domain experts [2]. However, conflict research- the empirical examination of political unrest, violence and civil war-has seen a growing emphasis on prediction and forecasting models. We describe automated machine learning (AutoML) to identify models, and human-guided machine learning (HGML), and show how these can incorporate domain knowledge and research requirements into model selection and assessment, and provide high quality machine learning pipelines to domain experts comparable to state-of-the-literature solutions. We examine three peer-reviewed papers with predictive models of conflict [3, 4, 5] and run their data through our HGML system using multiple AutoML engines and find this system produces slightly elevated performance on each paper's model, without any ML expertise required of the user. Our research has three takeaways for computational social science. First, predictive models of conflict would benefit from even minimal applications of AutoML; Secondly, human-guided machine learning offers the attractive option of constraining AutoML systems to address the kinds of questions conflict researchers assess with predictive models; Finally, current existing AutoML implementations produce divergent solutions and so can be productively harnessed in parallel.",
          "Abstract Racism and related concepts such as racist stereotypes and targeted hate speech are increasingly measured using the methodological toolkit of computational social science. While computational text-as-data approaches have many advantages, such as reducing the exposure to disturbing content for human coders or scalability, they also pose challenges for sensitive concepts, such as oversimplification and validity. To shed light on how racism and related concepts are computationally measured in textual data, we provide the first systematic literature review in this area, examining 115 relevant publications. We identify four common measurement pipelines used to study racism and related concepts. We find a wide variety of concepts under study, a strong dominance of social media data, especially from Twitter, and a strong preference for supervised classification models for this task. By critically discussing the current state of research, we identify gaps and provide recommendations for future research.",
          "Dogwhistles are coded expressions that simultaneously convey one meaning to a broad audience and a second, often hateful or provocative, meaning to a narrow in-group; they are deployed to evade both political repercussions and algorithmic content moderation. For example, the word \"cosmopolitan\" in a sentence such as \"we need to end the cosmopolitan experiment\" can mean \"worldly\" to many but also secretly mean \"Jewish\" to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians' speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3's performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detection, highlighting online risks presented by such coded language. This work sheds light on the theoretical and applied importance of dogwhistles in both NLP and computational social science, and provides resources to facilitate future research in modeling dogwhistles and mitigating their online harms.",
          "Computational social science research has made advances in machine learning and natural language processing that support content moderators in detecting harmful content. These advances often rely on training datasets annotated by crowdworkers for harmful content. In designing instructions for annotation tasks to generate training data for these algorithms, researchers often treat the harm concepts that we train algorithms to detect - 'hateful', 'offensive', 'toxic', 'racist', 'sexist', etc. - as interchangeable. In this work, we studied whether the way that researchers define 'harm' affects annotation outcomes. Using Venn diagrams, information gain comparisons, and content analyses, we reveal that annotators do not use the concepts 'hateful', 'offensive', and 'toxic' interchangeably. We identify that features of harm definitions and annotators' individual characteristics explain much of how annotators use these terms differently. Our results offer empirical evidence discouraging the common practice of using harm concepts interchangeably in content moderation research. Instead, researchers should make specific choices about which harm concepts to analyze based on their research goals. Recognizing that researchers are often resource constrained, we also encourage researchers to provide information to bound their findings when their concepts of interest differ from concepts that off-the-shelf harmful content detection algorithms identify. Finally, we encourage algorithm providers to ensure their instruments can adapt to contextually-specific content detection goals (e.g., soliciting instrument users' feedback).",
          "Every day, internet users encounter hateful and dangerous speech online, and some of them choose to respond directly in order to refute or undermine it. We call this counterspeech. Only a few studies have attempted to measure the effectiveness of counterspeech directly, and as far as we know, this is the first review of relevant literature.We've collected and reviewed related articles from a range of fields including political science, sociology, countering violent extremism, and computational social science. These articles do not all use the term \"counterspeech,\" but they shed light on various features of successful counterspeech, for example, qualities that make speakers/authors more influential in online interactions or the extent to which pro- and anti-social behavior is contagious on the internet.",
          "Deepfake technology is a threat to information integrity across social media platforms. Understanding how the public views and talks about these manipulations produced by AI is critical in the development of methods for countering them. However, manually analysing thousands of comments is labour-intensive and requires special knowledge. This dataset allows one to analyze the public stance and discourse patterns around deepfake content. I have extracted 2351 English comments from 41 YouTube videos that are about deepfakes between July 2025 and January 2026. The classification of each comment was done using BART-large-mnli for the detection of the stance and identification of the claims. Comments are assigned to four different types of stance: believesreal (where the user had concerns about threats from deepfake use), believesfake (where the user is skeptical), uncertain (where the user is doubtful), and metadiscussion (the user's general commentary about the situation). Six types of claims were identified: detectionliteracy (spotting techniques), voicefraud (audio cloning), warpropaganda (military context), celebrity (impersonation), scamfinance (financial fraud), and electionpolitics (political manipulation). Topic modeling using NMF identified 8 discussion themes (0.53 coherence), much better than LDA alternatives. We were able to track temporal changes over seven months using the divergence measure called Jensen-Shannon divergence, and we found empirical evidence of significant change points for discourse patterns. Privacy is ensured with SHA-256 hashing of any and all identifiers. This dataset serves these research areas of computational social science, misinformation detection, and content moderation.

          "Fake reviews have become prevalent on various social networks such as e-commerce and social media platforms. As fake reviews cause a heavily negative influence on the public, timely detection and response are of great significance. To this end, effective fake review detection has become an emerging research area that attracts increasing attention from various disciplines like network science, computational social science, and data science. An important line of research in fake review detection is to utilize graph learning methods, which incorporate both the attribute features of reviews and their relationships into the detection process. To further compare these graph learning methods in this paper, we conduct a detailed survey on fake review detection. The survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy and covers advancements in three high-level categories, including fake review detection, fake reviewer detection, and fake review analysis. Different kinds of fake reviews and their corresponding examples are also summarized. Furthermore, we discuss the graph learning methods, including supervised and unsupervised learning approaches for fake review detection. Specifically, we outline the unsupervised learning approach that includes generation-based and contrast-based methods, respectively. In view of the existing problems in the current methods and data, we further discuss some challenges and open issues in this field, including the imperfect data, explainability, model efficiency, and lightweight models.",
          "Computational social science research on automated social media accounts, colloquially dubbed “bots”, has tended to rely on binary verification methods to detect bot operations on social media. Typically focused on textual data from Twitter (now rebranded as \"X\"), these inference-based methods are prone to finding false positives and failing to understand the subtler ways in which bots operate over time, through visual content and in particular contexts. This research brings methodological contributions to such studies, focusing on what it calls “bolsobots” in Brazilian social media. Named after former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, the bolsobots refer to the extensive and skilful usage of partial or fully automated accounts by marketing teams, hackers, activists or campaign supporters. These accounts leverage online political culture to sway public opinion for or against public policies, opposition figures, or Bolsonaro himself. Drawing on empirical case studies, this paper implements quali-quanti visual methods to operationalise specific techniques for interpreting bot-associated image collections and textual content across Instagram, TikTok and Twitter/X. To unveil the modus operandi of bolsobots, we map the networks of users they follow (“following networks”), explore the visual-textual content they post, and observe the strategies they deploy to adapt to platform content moderation. Such analyses tackle methodological challenges inherent in bot studies by employing three key strategies: 1) designing context-sensitive queries and curating datasets with platforms’ interfaces and search engines to mitigate the limitations of bot scoring detectors, 2) engaging qualitatively with data visualisations to understand the vernaculars of bots, and 3) adopting a non-binary analysis framework that contextualises bots within their socio-technical environments. By acknowledging the intricate interplay between bots, user and platform cultures, this paper contributes to method innovation on bot studies and emerging quali-quanti visual methods literature.",

          "As researchers use computational methods to study complex social behaviors at scale, the validity of this computational social science depends on the integrity of the data. On July 2, 2015, Jason Baumgartner published a dataset advertised to include \"every publicly available Reddit comment\" which was quickly shared on Bittorrent and the Internet Archive. This data quickly became the basis of many academic papers on topics including machine learning, social behavior, politics, breaking news, and hate speech. We have discovered substantial gaps and limitations in this dataset which may contribute to bias in the findings of that research. In this paper, we document the dataset, substantial missing observations in the dataset, and the risks to research validity from those gaps. In summary, we identify strong risks to research that considers user histories or network analysis, moderate risks to research that compares counts of participation, and lesser risk to machine learning research that avoids making representative claims about behavior and participation on Reddit.",

          "We examine the disconnect between scholarship and practice in applying machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation across a corpus of 248 well-cited papers in the field. We then examine subsets of papers for data and code availability, design missteps, reproducibility, and generalizability. Our paper corpus includes published work in security, natural language processing, and computational social science. Across these disparate disciplines, we identify common errors in dataset and method design. In general, detection tasks are often meaningfully distinct from the challenges that online services actually face. Datasets and model evaluation are often non-representative of real-world contexts, and evaluation frequently is not independent of model training. We demonstrate the limitations of current detection methods in a series of three representative replication studies. Based on the results of these analyses and our literature survey, we conclude that the current state-of-the-art in fully-automated misinformation detection has limited efficacy in detecting human-generated misinformation. We offer recommendations for evaluating applications of machine learning to trust and safety problems and recommend future directions for research.",

In principle, natural language processing enables social scientists to systematically process large amounts of text, while rich domain knowledge helps machine learning scholars to build valid models of social phenomena. However, there is a lack of clear guidelines for constructing valid and reliable mixed methods approaches, which can increase the rigor and comparability of computational social science research. We provide a set of guidelines for leveraging human data annotation and automatic text classification at scale in five stages: (1) classification scheme development, (2) data labeling, (3) model selection, (4) model training and performance improvement, and (5) statistical analysis.

The analysis shows that some types of video content, for example those dealing with music or education, are more likely to attract positive comments than content related to policing or government meetings. In addition to their potential relevance for local government outreach, the study may represent a viable exploratory method for comparison of online video content and written comments in the context of computational social science analyses of user interaction and commenting behavior.",
          "Message from the OrganisersDigital technologies have brought myriad benefits for society, transforming how people connect, communicate and interact with each other.However, they have also enabled harmful and abusive behaviours to reach large audiences and for their negative effects to be amplified, including interpersonal aggression, bullying and hate speech.Already marginalised and vulnerable communities are often disproportionately at risk of receiving such abuse, compounding other social inequalities and injustices.The Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH) convenes research into these issues, particularly work that develops, interrogates and applies computational methods for detecting, classifying and modelling online abuse.Technical disciplines such as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) have made substantial advances in creating more powerful technologies to stop online abuse.Yet a growing body of work shows the limitations of many automated detection systems for tackling abusive online content, which can be biased, brittle, low performing and simplistic.These issues are magnified by the lack of explainability and transparency.And although WOAH is collocated with ACL and many of our papers are rooted firmly in the field of machine learning, these are not purely engineering challenges, but raise fundamental social questions of fairness and harm.For this reason, we continue to emphasise the need for inter-, cross-and anti-disciplinary work by inviting contributions from a range of fields, including but not limited to: NLP, machine learning, computational social sciences, law, politics, psychology, network analysis, sociology and cultural studies.In this fifth edition of WOAH we direct the conversation at the workshop through our theme: Social Bias and Unfairness in Online Abuse Detection Systems.Continuing the tradition started in WOAH 4, we have invited civil society, in particular individuals and organisations working with women and marginalised communities, to submit reports, case studies, findings, data, and to record their lived experiences through our civil society track.Our hope is that WOAH provides a platform to facilitate the interdisciplinary conversations and collaborations that are needed to effectively and ethically address online abuse.Speaking to the complex nature of the issue of online abuse, we are pleased to invite Leon Derczynski, currently an Associate Professor at ITU Copenhagen who works on a range of topics in Natural Language Processing; Deb Raji, currently a Research Fellow at Mozilla who researches AI accountability and auditing; Murali Shanmugavelan, currently a researcher at the Centre for Global Media and Communications at SOAS (London) to deliver keynotes.We are grateful to all our speakers for being available, and look forward to the dialogues that they will generate.On the day of WOAH the invited keynote speakers will give talks and then take part in a multi-disciplinary panel discussion to debate our theme and other issues in computational online abuse research.This will be followed by paper Q&A sessions, with facilitated discussions.Due to the virtual nature of this edition of the workshop, we have gathered papers into thematic panels to allow for more in-depth and rounded discussions.In this edition of the workshop, we introduce our first official Shared Task for fine-grained detection of hateful memes, in recognition of the ever-growing complexity of human communication.Memes and their communicative intent can be understood by humans because we jointly understand the text and pictures.In contrast, most AI systems analyze text and image separately and do not learn a joint representation.This is both inefficient and flawed, and such systems are likely to fail when a non-hateful image is combined with non-hateful text to produce content that is nonetheless still hateful.For AI to detect this sort of hate it must learn to understand content the way that people do: holistically.iii Continuing the success of past editions of the workshop, we received 48 submissions.Following a rigorous review process, we selected 24 submissions to be presented at the workshop.These include 13 long papers, 7 short papers, 3 shared-task system descriptions, and 1 extended abstract.The accepted papers cover a wide array of topics: Understanding the dynamics and nature of online abuse; BERTology: transformer-based modelling of online abuse; Datasets and language resources for online abuse; Fairness, bias and understandability of models; Analysing models to improve real-world performance; Resources for non-English languages.We are hugely excited about the discussions which will take place around these works.We are grateful to everyone who submitted their research and to our excellent team of reviewers.",

We begin by discussing the applications of LLMs in various computational problems in social science including sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, stance and humor detection, misinformation detection, event understanding, and social network analysis, illustrating their capacity to generate nuanced insights into human behavior and societal trends. Furthermore, we explore the innovative use of LLMs in generating social media content. We also discuss the various ethical, technical, and legal issues these applications pose, and considerations required for responsible LLM usage. We further present the challenges associated with data bias, privacy, and the integration of these models into existing research frameworks. This paper aims to provide a solid background on the potential of LLMs in CSS, their past applications, current problems, and how they can pave the way for revolutionizing CSS.",
          "In recent years, there has been an increasing exchange between social science and machine learning. In principle, natural language processing enables social scientists to systematically process large amounts of text, while rich domain knowledge helps machine learning scholars to build valid models of social phenomena. However, there is a lack of clear guidelines for constructing valid and reliable mixed methods approaches, which can increase the rigor and comparability of computational social science research. We provide a set of guidelines for leveraging human data annotation and automatic text classification at scale in five stages: (1) classification scheme development, (2) data labeling, (3) model selection, (4) model training and performance improvement, and (5) statistical analysis. Using examples from our own research on countering online hate, we outline potential problems and respective solutions. We demonstrate how consequently integrating expertise from social science and machine learning can enhance the study of diverse social phenomena.",
          "The issue of quantifying and characterizing various forms of social media manipulation and abuse has been at the forefront of the computational social science research community for over a decade. In this paper, I provide a (non-comprehensive) survey of research efforts aimed at estimating the prevalence of spam and false accounts on Twitter, as well as characterizing their use, activity, and behavior. I propose a taxonomy of spam and false accounts, enumerating known techniques used to create and detect them. Then, I summarize studies estimating the prevalence of spam and false accounts on Twitter. Finally, I report on research that illustrates how spam and false accounts are used for scams and frauds, stock market manipulation, political disinformation and deception, conspiracy amplification, coordinated influence, public health misinformation campaigns, radical propaganda and recruitment, and more. I will conclude with a set of recommendations aimed at charting the path forward to combat these problems.",
          "Hate speech spread on social media can strongly affect people and societies, especially when it targets a specific group of people in terms of religion, culture, or a specific social situation, such as refugees. For this reason, the detection and elimination of hate speech in social networks have attracted the attention of natural language processing researchers in recent years. A competition is organized to benchmark progress in Turkish hate speech recognition, within SIU2023 Computational Social Sciences special session, with four different tasks. A total of 20 teams registered for the competition, while eight teams submitted results at the end. The details of the winning models and their results are explained in this paper.",

          "Research in natural language processing (NLP) for Computational Social Science (CSS) heavily relies on data from social media platforms. This data plays a crucial role in the development of models for analysing socio-linguistic phenomena within online communities. In this work, we conduct an in-depth examination of 20 datasets extensively used in NLP for CSS to comprehensively examine data quality. Our analysis reveals that social media datasets exhibit varying levels of data duplication. Consequently, this gives rise to challenges like label inconsistencies and data leakage, compromising the reliability of models. Our findings also suggest that data duplication has an impact on the current claims of state-of-the-art performance, potentially leading to an overestimation of model effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we propose new protocols and best practices for improving dataset development from social media data and its usage.",

          "While social media are a key source of data for computational social science, their ease of manipulation by malicious actors threatens the integrity of online information exchanges and their analysis. In this Chapter, we focus on malicious social bots, a prominent vehicle for such manipulation. We start by discussing recent studies about the presence and actions of social bots in various online discussions to show their real-world implications and the need for detection methods. Then we discuss the challenges of bot detection methods and use Botometer, a publicly available bot detection tool, as a case study to describe recent developments in this area. We close with a practical guide on how to handle social bots in social media research.",
          "Social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook have connected billions of people and given the opportunity to the users to share their ideas and opinions instantly. That being said, there are several negative consequences as well such as online harassment, trolling, cyber-bullying, fake news, and hate speech. Out of these, hate speech presents a unique challenge as it is deeply engraved into our society and is often linked with offline violence. Social media platforms rely on human moderators to identify hate speech and take necessary action. However, with the increase in online hate speech, these platforms are turning toward automated hate speech detection and mitigation systems. This shift brings several challenges to the plate, and hence, is an important avenue to explore for the computation social science community.",
          "Online hate speech represents a serious problem exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although often anchored in real-world social divisions, hate speech in cyberspace may also be fueled inorganically by inauthentic actors like social bots. This work presents and employs a methodological pipeline for assessing the links between hate speech and bot-driven activity through the lens of social cybersecurity. Using a combination of machine learning and network science tools, we empirically characterize Twitter conversations about the pandemic in the United States and the Philippines. Our integrated analysis reveals idiosyncratic relationships between bots and hate speech across datasets, highlighting different network dynamics of racially charged toxicity in the US and political conflicts in the Philippines. Most crucially, we discover that bot activity is linked to higher hate in both countries, especially in communities which are denser and more isolated from others. We discuss several insights for probing issues of online hate speech and coordinated disinformation, especially through a global approach to computational social science.",
          "The growth of online platforms has amplified the spread of conspiracy theories, presenting a significant challenge to social cohesion and online safety. While platforms like Twitter and Facebook have received considerable academic attention, the unique ecosystem of YouTube comments remains comparatively underexplored as a site of conspiratorial discourse. This dissertation addresses this gap by presenting a systematic investigation into the detection of conspiratorial narratives within YouTube comments using a comparative evaluation of artificial intelligence techniques. This dissertation presents and validates a multiphase methodological framework through a systematic empirical investigation. The research first conducts an exploratory discourse analysis of a prominent case study, the 2023 Maui wildfires, to identify the distinct linguistic, emotional and topical signatures of conspiratorial content. Building on these findings, a novel dataset of over 7,300 YouTube comments is manually annotated. The core of the study is a rigorous comparative evaluation of three tiers of AI detection methods: (1) traditional machine learning models (e.g., SVM, XGBoost) using engineered text and psycholinguistic features; (2) fine-tuned Transformer models (BERT, BERTweet); and (3) zero-shot classification with Large Language Models (LLMs). The results reveal a clear hierarchy of performance, with LLMs demonstrating superior accuracy, achieving a top F1-score of 0.880. Notably, a hybrid approach combining Google’s foundation model embeddings with an XGBoost classifier also performed exceptionally well, outperforming the fine-tuned Transformer models. A key finding is that the explicit addition of sentiment and emotion features did not consistently improve model performance. This suggests that the rich, high-dimensional embeddings from modern foundation models already implicitly encode these psycholinguistic signals, rendering separate feature engineering mostly redundant. This research concludes that the effective detection of nuanced, narrative-driven phenomena like conspiracy theories is increasingly dependent on deep semantic understanding rather than surface-level linguistic markers. The findings hold significant implications for both computational social science and practical content moderation,advocating for a shift towards leveraging foundation models and suggesting a prag�matic, structured approach for developing scalable moderation systems.

          "This three-article dissertation focuses on cyber-related topics on terrorist groups, specifically Jihadists’ use of technology, the application of natural language processing, and social networks in analyzing text data derived from terrorists' Dark Web forums. The first article explores cybercrime and cyberterrorism. As technology progresses, it facilitates new forms of behavior, including tech-related crimes known as cybercrime and cyberterrorism. In this article, I provide an analysis of the problems of cybercrime and cyberterrorism within the field of criminology by reviewing existing literature focusing on (a) the issues in defining terrorism, cybercrime, and cyberterrorism, (b) ways that cybercriminals commit a crime in cyberspace, and (c) ways that cyberterrorists attack critical infrastructure, including computer systems, data, websites, and servers. The second article is a methodological study examining the application of natural language processing computational techniques, specifically latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models and topic network analysis of text data. I demonstrate the potential of topic models by inductively analyzing large-scale textual data of Jihadist groups and supporters from three Dark Web forums to uncover underlying topics. The Dark Web forums are dedicated to Islam and the Islamic world discussions. Some members of these forums sympathize with and support terrorist organizations. Results indicate that topic modeling can be applied to analyze text data automatically; the most prevalent topic in all forums was religion. Forum members also discussed terrorism and terrorist attacks, supporting the Mujahideen fighters. A few of the discussions were related to relationships and marriages, advice, seeking help, health, food, selling electronics, and identity cards. LDA topic modeling is significant for finding topics from larger corpora such as the Dark Web forums. Implications for counterterrorism include the use of topic modeling in real-time classification and removal of online terrorist content and the monitoring of religious forums, as terrorist groups use religion to justify their goals and recruit in such forums for supporters. The third article builds on the second article, exploring the network structures of terrorist groups on the Dark Web forums. The two Dark Web forums' interaction networks were created, and network properties were measured using social network analysis. A member is considered connected and interacting with other forum members when they post in the same threads forming an interaction network. Results reveal that the network structure is decentralized, sparse, and divided based on topics (religion, terrorism, current events, and relationships) and the members' interests in participating in the threads. As participation in forums is an active process, users tend to select platforms most compatible with their views, forming a subgroup or community. However, some members are essential and influential in the information and resources flow within the networks. The key members frequently posted about religion, terrorism, and relationships in multiple threads. Identifying key members is significant for counterterrorism, as mapping network structures and key users are essential for removing and destabilizing terrorist networks. Taken together, this dissertation applies a computational social science approach to the analysis of cyberterrorism and the use of Dark Web forums by jihadists.",
          "Social media platforms, especially Instagram, have become a significant source of digital communication where users can interact through satire, humour, and irony. Sarcasm is a rhetorical device primarily used to convey hidden meaning, criticism, or humour. This study examined sarcastic comments on the Instagram page @Sarcastic_us, categorising them into different types of Sarcasm based on contextual and linguistic features. A descriptive, qualitative approach was employed to analyse 600 comments from 30 posts using content analysis. Key findings of the study reveal six primary types of Sarcasm employed by Instagram users: absurd Sarcasm, deadpan Sarcasm, polite Sarcasm, playful Sarcasm, ironic Sarcasm, and self-deprecating Sarcasm. The study analysed different types of Sarcasm in Instagram comments. It also presented the most dominant form of self-deprecating Sarcasm (30%), which is used for humour and relevance. Additionally, exaggeration and emojis play a crucial role in amplifying the Sarcasm. The study contributes to the understanding of Sarcasm in digital spaces, taking into account such challenges and enhancing sentiment analysis. Future studies should focus on AI-driven sarcasm detection models incorporating multimodal cues to enhance accuracy. References Austin, J. L. (1962). How to do things with words.

          "Today fabricated information is easily distributed throughout social media platforms and the internet, allowing embellished information to effortlessly slip through, misinform and manipulate the public to an attacker's erroneous execution. Falsified information –also known as \"fake news\" -- has been around for many centuries, but today it presents a unique challenge because it can affect voting patterns, political careers, new business product roll-outs, and countless other information consumption processes. This paper proposes a method that uses machine learning, and Bayes' theorem to identify \"Fake News\" stories. We use Bayesian estimators to calculate the conditional probability that a story is fake given the presence of feature predictors inside a news story. We present a concise summary of the qualitative methods used to study Fake News stories followed by the Computational Social Science and Machine Learning methods used to train and tune a classifier to detect Fake News. We expose some of the main linguistic trends identified in social media platforms associated with Fake News. We close the paper proposing a larger integrated system that can be used to identify and autonomously archive falsified content.",

          "The phenomenon of misinformation spreading in social media has developed a new form of active citizens who focus on tackling the problem by refuting posts that might contain misinformation. Automatically identifying and characterizing the behavior of such active citizens in social media is an important task in computational social science for complementing studies in misinformation analysis. In this paper, we study this task across different social media platforms (i.e., Twitter and Weibo) and languages (i.e., English and Chinese) for the first time. To this end, (1) we develop and make publicly available a new dataset of Weibo users mapped into one of the two categories (i.e., misinformation posters or active citizens); (2) we evaluate a battery of supervised models on our new Weibo dataset and an existing Twitter dataset which we repurpose for the task; and (3) we present an extensive analysis of the differences in language use between the two user categories.1",

          "This study investigates the dynamics of anti-Muslim hate speech within Norwegian social media during the period between 2010 and 2021. Using a dataset of more than one million comments from Twitter and Facebook, we developed a custom hate speech classifier trained on an annotated corpus of 3,277 comments in Norwegian language. We identify that despite representing a small share of the total comments, hate speech content has increased over time. In an effort to understand the social network characteristics of hate speech content, we delve deeper into Twitter conversations as we can more easily identify how this content is spread. We develop network metrics to assess the prevalence, distribution, and diffusion of hateful content. The findings reveal that regardless of the number of users or tweets in a conversation, the volume of hateful content tends to remain constant. Furthermore, a small fraction of users contribute disproportionately to the dissemination of hate speech, with most conversations being limited in participant diversity. These results contribute to the growing field of computational social science by offering a novel methodology for studying hate speech in under-resourced languages and suggesting that mitigating hate speech may be possible through targeted network interventions rather than content removal alone.",

          "Abstract Some scientific models and some claims about model–target relations are fruitfully diagnosed as dogwhistles. Dogwhistles , broadly speaking, are speech acts that send different, conflicting, and often differentially inflammatory messages to listeners. I distinguish two ways in which scientific models can be dogwhistles: representational dogwhistling and fit-for-purpose dogwhistling. I illustrate both kinds of dogwhistling using an example from computational social science, the diversity trumps ability theorem. I argue that dogwhistling threatens the objectivity of science, and I propose some ameliorative strategies."

          "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human perspectives via persona prompting is gaining traction in computational social science. However, well-curated, empirically grounded persona collections remain scarce, limiting the accuracy and representativeness of such simulations. Here we introduce the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a comprehensive and representative persona prompt collection built from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity. Furthermore, we analyze how the representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses. Our findings suggest that GGP provides a potentially valuable resource for research on LLM-based social simulations that enables more systematic explorations of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs), through their exposure to massive collections of online text, learn to reproduce the perspectives and linguistic styles of diverse social and cultural groups. This capability suggests a powerful social scientific application – the simulation of empirically realistic, culturally situated human subjects. Synthesizing recent research in artificial intelligence and computational social science, we outline a methodological foundation for simulating human subjects and their social interactions. We then identify nine characteristics of current models that are likely to impair realistic simulation human subjects, including atemporality, social acceptability bias, uniformity, and poverty of sensory experience. For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program on the simulation of human subjects that keeps pace with rapid technical progress.",

Study of the impact of any event whether positive or negative that directly or indirectly influence the comments of the people stands as a factor affecting the elections. SLEPS is a proposed framework that uses large heterogeneous data set to train dual layer neural nets to increase the credibility and authenticity of polls. In SLEPS, we map data of any presidential or gubernatorial election comprising of social traits to statistical learning using neural nets. It is “self-learning’’ as it involves importance weighting of experts that incorporates features that affect election prediction viz. facial appearance, deliberate judgment, character traits and background data of the contestant. SLEPS was evaluated over Indian Elections of 1985 and predicted the winner with root mean square error of 0.04 and 76% precision.",
          "We present a comparative docking experiment that aligns human-subject interview data with large language model (LLM)-driven synthetic personas to evaluate fidelity, divergence, and blind spots in AI-enabled simulation. Fifteen early-stage startup founders were interviewed about their hopes and concerns regarding AI-powered validation, and the same protocol was replicated with AI-generated founder and investor personas. A structured thematic synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes - commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps - founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes - relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by missing negative historical experiences. We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of lived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical studies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category - capable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and clarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science.",
          "Understanding and modeling the flow of information in human societies is essential for capturing phenomena such as polarization, opinion formation, and misinformation diffusion. Traditional agent-based models often rely on simplified behavioral rules that fail to capture the nuanced and context-sensitive nature of human decision-making. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as data-driven, high-fidelity agents capable of simulating individual opinions under varying informational conditions. Conditioning LLMs on real survey data from the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES), we investigate their ability to predict individual-level responses across a spectrum of political and social issues in a zero-shot setting, without any training on the survey outcomes. Using Jensen–Shannon distance to quantify divergence in opinion distributions and F1-score to measure predictive accuracy, we compare LLM-generated simulations to those produced by a supervised Random Forest model. While performance at the individual level is comparable, LLMs consistently produce aggregate opinion distributions closer to the empirical ground truth. These findings suggest that LLMs offer a promising new method for simulating complex opinion dynamics and modeling the probabilistic structure of belief systems in computational social science.",
          "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for computational social science research at scale. Building upon prior explorations of LLM agent design, our work introduces a simulated agent society where complex social relationships dynamically form and evolve over time. Agents are imbued with psychological drives and placed in a sandbox survival environment. We conduct an evaluation of the agent society through the lens of Thomas Hobbes's seminal Social Contract Theory (SCT). We analyze whether, as the theory postulates, agents seek to escape a brutish \"state of nature\" by surrendering rights to an absolute sovereign in exchange for order and security. Our experiments unveil an alignment: Initially, agents engage in unrestrained conflict, mirroring Hobbes's depiction of the state of nature. However, as the simulation progresses, social contracts emerge, leading to the authorization of an absolute sovereign and the establishment of a peaceful commonwealth founded on mutual cooperation. This congruence between our LLM agent society's evolutionary trajectory and Hobbes's theoretical account indicates LLMs' capability to model intricate social dynamics and potentially replicate forces that shape human societies. By enabling such insights into group behavior and emergent societal phenomena, LLM-driven multi-agent simulations, while unable to simulate all the nuances of human behavior, may hold potential for advancing our understanding of social structures, group dynamics, and complex human systems.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for simulations, enabling applications in role-playing agents and Computational Social Science (CSS). However, the reliability of these simulations is under-explored, which raises concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs in these applications. In this paper, we aim to answer ``How reliable is LLM-based simulation?'' To address this, we introduce TrustSim, an evaluation dataset covering 10 CSS-related topics, to systematically investigate the reliability of the LLM simulation. We conducted experiments on 14 LLMs and found that inconsistencies persist in the LLM-based simulated roles. In addition, the consistency level of LLMs does not strongly correlate with their general performance. To enhance the reliability of LLMs in simulation, we proposed Adaptive Learning Rate Based ORPO (AdaORPO), a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to improve the reliability in simulation across 7 LLMs. Our research provides a foundation for future studies to explore more robust and trustworthy LLM-based simulations.",
          "Multi-agent role-playing has recently shown promise for studying social behavior with language agents, but existing simulations are mostly monolingual and fail to model cross-lingual interaction, an essential property of real societies. We introduce MASim, the first multilingual agent-based simulation framework that supports multi-turn interaction among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic profiles. MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions. Experiments on calibration, sensitivity, consistency, and cultural case studies show that MASim reproduces sociocultural phenomena and highlights the importance of multilingual simulation for scalable, controlled computational social science.",
          "Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for enabling AI systems for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using {\\em value profiles} -- natural language descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model to estimate ratings conditioned on a value profile or other rater information. To measure the predictive information in rater representations, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value profiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations ( 70% information preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.",
          "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human perspectives via persona prompting is gaining traction in computational social science. However, well-curated, empirically grounded persona collections remain scarce, limiting the accuracy and representativeness of such simulations. Here we introduce the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a comprehensive and representative persona prompt collection built from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity. Furthermore, we analyze how the representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses. Our findings suggest that GGP provides a potentially valuable resource for research on LLM-based social simulations that enables more systematic explorations of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research.",
          "Modeling complex human behavior, such as voter decisions in national elections, is a long-standing challenge for computational social science. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) are limited by oversimplified rules, while large-scale statistical models often lack interpretability. We introduce FlockVote, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a \"computational laboratory\" of LLM agents for political simulation. Each agent is instantiated with a high-fidelity demographic profile and dynamic contextual information (e.g. candidate policies), enabling it to perform nuanced, generative reasoning to simulate a voting decision. We deploy this framework as a testbed on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on seven key swing states. Our simulation's macro-level results successfully replicate the real-world outcome, demonstrating the high fidelity of our \"virtual society\". The primary contribution is not only the prediction, but also the framework's utility as an interpretable research tool. FlockVote moves beyond black-box outputs, allowing researchers to probe agent-level rationale and analyze the stability and sensitivity of LLM-driven social simulations.",
          "Using persona-conditioned LLMs as synthetic survey respondents has become a common practice in computational social science and agent-based simulations. Yet, it remains unclear whether multi- attribute persona prompting improves LLM reliability or instead introduces distortions. Here we contribute to this assessment by leveraging a large dataset of U.S. microdata from the World Values Survey. Concretely, we evaluate two open-weight chat models and a random-guesser baseline across more than 70K respondent–item instances. We find that persona prompting does not yield a clear aggregate improvement in survey alignment and, in many cases, significantly degrades performance. Persona effects are highly het- erogeneous as most items exhibit minimal change, while a small subset of questions and underrepresented subgroups experience disproportionate distortions. Our findings highlight a key adverse impact of current persona-based simulation practices: demographic conditioning can redistribute error in ways that undermine sub- group fidelity and risk misleading downstream analyses.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs), through their exposure to massive collections of online text, learn to reproduce the perspectives and linguistic styles of diverse social and cultural groups. This capability suggests a powerful social scientific application – the simulation of empirically realistic, culturally situated human subjects. Synthesizing recent research in artificial intelligence and computational social science, we outline a methodological foundation for simulating human subjects and their social interactions. We then identify nine characteristics of current models that are likely to impair realistic simulation human subjects, including atemporality, social acceptability bias, uniformity, and poverty of sensory experience. For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program on the simulation of human subjects that keeps pace with rapid technical progress.",
          "Role-playing has wide-ranging applications in customer support, embodied agents, and computational social science. The influence of parametric world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) often causes role-playing characters to act out of character and to hallucinate about things outside the scope of their knowledge. In this work, we focus on the evaluation and mitigation of hallucination in fictional character role-play. We introduce a dataset with over 2,000 characters and 72,000 interviews, including 18,000 adversarial questions. We propose RoleFact, a role-playing method that mitigates hallucination by modulating the influence of parametric knowledge using a pre-calibrated confidence threshold. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the factual precision of generated responses by 18% for adversarial questions with a 44% reduction in temporal hallucination for time-sensitive interviews. The code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/NafisSadeq/rolefact.git.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.",
          "Computational social experiments, which typically employ agent-based modeling to create testbeds for piloting social experiments, not only provide a computational solution to the major challenges faced by traditional experimental methods, but have also gained widespread attention in various research fields. Despite their significance, their broader impact is largely limited by the underdeveloped intelligence of their core component, i.e., agents. To address this limitation, we develop a framework grounded in well-established social science theories and practices, consisting of three key elements: (i) large language model (LLM)-driven experimental agents, serving as \"silicon participants\", (ii) methods for implementing various interventions or treatments, and (iii) tools for collecting behavioral, survey, and interview data. We evaluate its effectiveness by replicating three representative experiments, with results demonstrating strong alignment, both quantitatively and qualitatively, with real-world evidence. This work provides the first framework for designing LLM-driven agents to pilot social experiments, underscoring the transformative potential of LLMs and their agents in computational social science",
          "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.",

          "This study explores the capacity of large language model-powered agents to simulate human-like behavior in multi-agent social systems. Using Secret Hitler — a hidden-role board game centered on trust, deception, and strategic communication — we evaluate how LLM agents navigate dynamic group interactions. Our findings show that agents exhibit human-like behaviors, including strategic temporal adaptation, contextual reasoning, and complex social cognition such as theory of mind and implicit coordination. Notably, 85% of agent decisions factored in at least two other players’ mental states, highlighting their capacity for multi-agent mental state inference. However, they struggled with key aspects of human gameplay, including more nuanced strategic deception, emotional subtlety, and fluid conversational dynamics. These insights contribute to computational social science, agent-based modeling, and game theory, advancing our understanding of the potential of LLMs to simulate complex social interaction.",
          "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way humans interact with AI systems, transforming a wide range of fields and disciplines. In this talk, I share two distinct approaches to empowering human-AI interaction using LLMs. The first one explores how LLMstransform computational social science, and how human-AI collaboration can reduce costs and improve the efficiency of social science research. The second part looks at social skill learning via LLMs by empowering therapists and learners with LLM-empowered feedback and deliberative practices. These two works demonstrate how human-AI collaboration via LLMs can empower individuals and foster positive change. We conclude by discussing how LLMs enable collaborative intelligence by redefining the interactions between humans and AI systems.",
          "The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds, there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted. With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.",
          "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation. Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate, flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy applications.",
          "Social surveys in computational social science are well-designed by elaborate domain theories that can effectively reflect the interviewee's deep thoughts without concealing their true feelings. The candidate questionnaire options highly depend on the interviewee's previous answer, which results in the complexity of social survey analysis, the time, and the expertise required. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning is well-enhanced by prompting learning such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) but still confined to left-to-right decision-making processes or limited paths during inference. This means they can fall short in problems that require exploration and uncertainty searching. In response, a novel large language model prompting method, called Random Forest of Thoughts (RFoT), is proposed for generating uncertainty reasoning to fit the area of computational social science. The RFoT allows LLMs to perform deliberate decision-making by generating diverse thought space and randomly selecting the sub-thoughts to build the forest of thoughts. It can extend the exploration and prediction of overall performance, benefiting from the extensive research space of response. The method is applied to optimize computational social science analysis on two datasets covering a spectrum of social survey analysis problems. Our experiments show that RFoT significantly enhances language models' abilities on two novel social survey analysis problems requiring non-trivial reasoning.",
          "This study seeks to identify and quantify biases in simulating political samples with Large Language Models, specifically focusing on vote choice and public opinion. Using the GPT-3.5-Turbo model, we leverage data from the American National Election Studies, German Longitudinal Election Study, Zuobiao Dataset, and China Family Panel Studies to simulate voting behaviors and public opinions. This methodology enables us to examine three types of representation bias: disparities based on the the country's language, demographic groups, and political regime types. The findings reveal that simulation performance is generally better for vote choice than for public opinions, more accurate in English-speaking countries, more effective in bipartisan systems than in multi-partisan systems, and stronger in democratic settings than in authoritarian regimes. These results contribute to enhancing our understanding and developing strategies to mitigate biases in AI applications within the field of computational social science.",
          "Persona-driven LLMs have emerged as powerful tools in computational social science, yet existing approaches fall at opposite extremes, either relying on costly human-curated data or producing synthetic personas that lack consistency and realism. We introduce SYNTHIA, a dataset of 30,000 backstories derived from 10,000 real social media users from BlueSky open platform across three time windows, bridging this spectrum by grounding synthetic generation in authentic user activity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SYNTHIA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in demographic diversity and social survey alignment while significantly outperforming them in narrative consistency. Uniquely, SYNTHIA incorporates temporal dimensionality and provides rich social interaction metadata from the underlying network, enabling new research directions in computational social science and persona-driven language modeling.",
          "Predicting how populations respond to policy interventions is a fundamental challenge in computational social science and public policy. Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis. We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior. We discuss implications for policy simulation, limitations of the approach, and directions for extending LLM-based digital twins beyond pandemic response.",

          "Behavioral public policy has increasingly proposed alternate toolkits, such as the boost or nudge+, to counter several limitations of nudges. While there is growing evidence that these toolkits can be more effective and legitimate than nudging in certain contexts (Banerjee et al., 2023), practitioners and policymakers struggle to differentiate between them. In this correspondence, we argue that an increasing pluralism through multiple toolkits in the toolbox of the behavioral scientist is meaningful if and only if there are clearer rules to uniquely design and identify these policies. In fact, to harness pluralism, practitioners must have guidance and thumb rules that help them choose one toolkit over the other in a given scenario. We suggest this is possible with recent developments in computational social science, using insights from machine learning and large language models (LLMs), that can be used to understand heterogeneity in the effectiveness of behavioral interventions (BIs). For example, LLMs can enhance experimental designs by generating synthetic participants to complement real ones, improving covariate balancing, model validation, and adaptive randomization, ultimately making studies more efficient and robust in exploring treatment effect heterogeneity. Uncovering this heterogeneity can establish causal evidence on the precursors and mechanisms underlying behavioral change strategies, enabling researchers to personalize these BI toolkits.",
          "\"Synthetic samples\" based on large language models (LLMs) have been argued to serve as efficient alternatives to surveys of humans, assuming that their training data includes information on human attitudes and behavior. However, LLM-synthetic samples might exhibit bias, for example due to training data and fine-tuning processes being unrepresentative of diverse contexts. Such biases risk reinforcing existing biases in research, policymaking, and society. Therefore, researchers need to investigate if and under which conditions LLM-generated synthetic samples can be used for public opinion prediction. In this study, we examine to what extent LLM-based predictions of individual public opinion exhibit context-dependent biases by predicting the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections. Prompting three LLMs with individual-level background information of 26,000 eligible European voters, we ask the LLMs to predict each person's voting behavior. By comparing them to the actual results, we show that LLM-based predictions of future voting behavior largely fail, their accuracy is unequally distributed across national and linguistic contexts, and they require detailed attitudinal information in the prompt. The findings emphasize the limited applicability of LLM-synthetic samples to public opinion prediction. In investigating their contextual biases, this study contributes to the understanding and mitigation of inequalities in the development of LLMs and their applications in computational social science.",
          "Large language models (LLMs) are increasing in capability and popularity, propelling their application in new domains -- including as replacements for human participants in computational social science, user testing, annotation tasks, and more. In many settings, researchers seek to distribute their surveys to a sample of participants that are representative of the underlying human population of interest. This means in order to be a suitable replacement, LLMs will need to be able to capture the influence of positionality (i.e., relevance of social identities like gender and race). However, we show that there are two inherent limitations in the way current LLMs are trained that prevent this. We argue analytically for why LLMs are likely to both misportray and flatten the representations of demographic groups, then empirically show this on 4 LLMs through a series of human studies with 3200 participants across 16 demographic identities. We also discuss a third limitation about how identity prompts can essentialize identities. Throughout, we connect each limitation to a pernicious history of epistemic injustice against the value of lived experiences that explains why replacement is harmful for marginalized demographic groups. Overall, we urge caution in use cases where LLMs are intended to replace human participants whose identities are relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, in cases where the benefits of LLM replacement are determined to outweigh the harms (e.g., the goal is to supplement rather than fully replace, engaging human participants may cause them harm), we provide inference-time techniques that we empirically demonstrate do reduce, but do not remove, these harms.",
          "This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition, including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations. Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity, calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA, Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of classical rule-based systems.",
          "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as digital respondents and generative agents in computational social science, prior work has primarily focused on the fidelity of their expressed opinions, often overlooking a fundamental question: the behavioral stability of outputs across repeated runs of the same model when the persona specification and task conditions remain unchanged. This paper proposes a behavioral stability evaluation framework for role-playing tasks, using the Political Compass questionnaire as the testbed. The questionnaire maps responses onto a two-dimensional coordinate system defined by an economic axis and a social axis, enabling political orientations to be directly quantified and compared in a continuous space. To ground the simulation in realistic user behaviors, we construct personas from publicly available social media texts and stratify them based on Political Signal Clarity. Across three LLMs, we compare repeated questionnaire completions under different decoding temperatures and prompting strategies. We characterize it along two complementary dimensions: dispersion of the resulting two-dimensional coordinates across runs, measured by an Overall Stability Score (OSS), and dispersion of per-item choices across runs, quantified by response entropy. We further use linear mixed-effects models to account for persona-level heterogeneity and to estimate the effects of key factors on stability. Our results show that coordinate drift and item-level dispersion do not always move in tandem. Increasing temperature typically amplifies variability, although models differ in their sensitivity. Contrary to its success in reasoning tasks, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting failed to enhance stability in this value-laden context. Instead, it frequently amplified coordinate drift by introducing stochasticity into intermediate reasoning steps. Results show that LLMs exhibit greater behavioral stability when role-playing personas with clearer political signals. These findings suggest that stability should be treated as a pre-study benchmark before deploying LLM-based role-playing simulations, and that key generation settings and stability statistics should be reported alongside substantive conclusions.",
          "Powered by large language models (LLMs), AI agents have become capable of many human tasks. Using the most canonical definitions of the Big Five personality, we measure the ability of LLMs to negotiate within a game-theoretical framework, as well as methodological challenges to measuring notions of fairness and risk. Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with high toxicity. These results indicate that LLMs may have built-in guardrails that default to fair behavior, but can be \"jail broken\" to exploit agreeable opponents. We also offer pragmatic insight in how negotiation bots can be designed, and a framework of assessing negotiation behavior based on game theory and computational social science.",

We conduct initial proof-of-concept simulations to explore a central research question: Can non-trivial social phenomena emerge from purely AI-to-AI interactions? Our early results, while limited in scope, suggest the spontaneous formation of patterns such as opinion clustering and informal leadership hierarchies. This work serves primarily as a foundational proposal and call for collaboration, highlighting the potential—and the significant technical and ethical challenges—of using LLM-based agents as a novel tool for computational social science and “artificial society” research.

          "Modeling complex human behavior, such as voter decisions in national elections, is a long-standing challenge for computational social science. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) are limited by oversimplified rules, while large-scale statistical models often lack interpretability. We introduce FlockVote, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a \"computational laboratory\" of LLM agents for political simulation. Each agent is instantiated with a high-fidelity demographic profile and dynamic contextual information (e.g. candidate policies), enabling it to perform nuanced, generative reasoning to simulate a voting decision. We deploy this framework as a testbed on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on seven key swing states. Our simulation's macro-level results successfully replicate the real-world outcome, demonstrating the high fidelity of our \"virtual society\". The primary contribution is not only the prediction, but also the framework's utility as an interpretable research tool. FlockVote moves beyond black-box outputs, allowing researchers to probe agent-level rationale and analyze the stability and sensitivity of LLM-driven social simulations.",
          "Large language models (LLMs), through their exposure to massive collections of online text, learn to reproduce the perspectives and linguistic styles of diverse social and cultural groups. This capability suggests a powerful social scientific application—the simulation of empirically realistic, culturally situated human subjects. Synthesizing recent research in artificial intelligence and computational social science, we outline a methodological foundation for simulating human subjects and their social interactions. We then identify six characteristics of current models that are likely to impair the realistic simulation of human subjects: bias, uniformity, atemporality, disembodiment, linguistic cultures, and alien intelligence. For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program for the simulation of human subjects that keeps pace with rapid technical progress, and caution that validation against human subjects data remains essential to ensure simulation accuracy.",

          "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) opens new frontiers for social simulation, enabling their use as autonomous social agents. In this preliminary study and position paper, we propose an experimental framework for simulating a fully artificial social media platform populated exclusively by LLM-based agents with distinct personalities and goals. We conduct initial proof-of-concept simulations to explore a central research question: Can non-trivial social phenomena emerge from purely AI-to-AI interactions? Our early results, while limited in scope, suggest the spontaneous formation of patterns such as opinion clustering and informal leadership hierarchies. This work serves primarily as a foundational proposal and call for collaboration, highlighting the potential—and the significant technical and ethical challenges—of using LLM-based agents as a novel tool for computational social science and “artificial society” research. We outline a detailed roadmap for future work to validate and extend these initial observations.",
          "Modeling real-world social situations has proven to be one of the most daunting challenges in computational social science. With the exception of simplistic, single-domain scenarios, most computational models are quickly overwhelmed with the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we apply intent-driven modeling to a complex, real-world scenario. By mapping actors' intentions to their beliefs and goals, we are able to explain their actions and propose predictions of future actions. Specifically, we look at ways to help understand and explain complex group behaviors during epidemics in relation to national borders. Using an intent-driven socio-cultural behavioral model implemented with the help of Bayesian Knowledge Bases (BKBs), we explore the actions and reactions of actors in an epidemic setting, providing insight into behaviors affecting border security. Using these tools, we are able to employ dynamic, multi-domain modeling to explain the decisions and actions taken by actors in the scenario. We validate our methodology by modeling and analyzing migration behaviors during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Mexico.",
          "The potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as instruments for measuring social phenomena is constrained by the methodological limitations of current probing techniques. Prevailing methods rely on static, handcrafted probe sets whose quality is highly dependent on their authors' subjective expertise. This results in measurement tools with inconsistent statistical reliability that defy systematic optimization. Such an \"artisanal\" approach, akin to using an \"uneven ruler,\" undermines the scientific rigor of its findings and severely limits the applicability of LLMs in the social sciences. To elevate bias measurement from a craft to a science, we introduce the Psychometric-driven Probe Optimization (PMPO) framework. This framework treats a probe set as an optimizable scientific instrument and, for the first time, utilizes a Neural Genetic Algorithm that leverages a powerful LLM as a \"neural genetic operator.\" Through a hybrid strategy of gradient-guided mutation and creative rephrasing, PMPO automatically enhances the probe set's reliability, sensitivity, and diversity. We first establish the external validity of our foundational measurement method (PLC), demonstrating a high correlation between its measurement of occupational gender bias and real-world U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data (average Pearson's r=0.83, p<.001). Building on this, we show that the PMPO framework can elevate a standard probe set's internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) from 0.90 to an exceptional 0.96 within 10 generations. Critically, in a rigorous, double-blind \"Turing Test,\" probes evolved by PMPO from non-expert seeds were judged by sociology experts to have achieved a level of quality, sophistication, and nuance that is comparable to, and even indistinguishable from, those handcrafted by domain experts. This work provides a systematic pathway to upgrade LLM measurement tools from artisanal artifacts to automated scientific instruments, offering an unprecedented and trustworthy tool for AI safety auditing and computational social science.",
          "In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses."

          "This paper interrogates the informational practices shared between human and computer machine learners as they train to sense the world through lines of order, or vectors. The paper does this by exploring the affective conditions through which vectors draw relations of data over a persistent, colonial image of race. Through analysis of pedagogical practices at the Summer Institute for Computational Social Science in Chicago, and a corresponding year-long machine learning design group, this paper examines how contemporary machine learning practitioners train themselves to sense calculative relationality on the basis of racialized difference. The paper compares this vectorized sensibility with 20th century enumerative practices in the United States by analyzing the racial statistics of W.E.B. Du Bois, Kelly Miller, and Frances Kellor to trace out affective histories of the vector. Ultimately, this paper asks how machine learners – whether algorithms or their human users – often project lines of colonial order upon other forms of life, and how, by questioning the claim of vector relations and their informational objects, we can confront this sense-training and reimagine ourselves.",

          "This session explored cutting edge developments in relation to AI for Science and, in particular, AI and Data. AI offers groundbreaking opportunities and poses numerous challenges regarding the reproducibility of science and the conduct of scientists. How do we prepare AI-ready data, build and use specialized AI models, while establishing ground truths and a new form of explainability? What response is necessary from science policy makers, leaders, and decision makers? The session will include a discussion of the essential scientific response to AI developments from various perspectives, including those of scientists and AI specialists, and of policy makers. The session will also feature the launch of ISC Policy Primers and the CODATA White Paper on the Role of Data in AI for Science. The presentations will be followed by structured discussion and audience involvement. Chair: Simon Hodson, CODATA Executive Director Speakers: 1) Mercè Crosas, Director of Computational Social Science, Barcelona Supercomputing Center and CODATA President: ‘Becoming AI-ready in Science’. Mercè will open the session and describe the landscape of AI developments in scientific research, highlighting the steps needed to use, modify, or develop AI models in science without compromising rigor and open science principles. The talk will include a discussion of the best practices and standards that need to be extended to help domain scientists and research/AI engineers prepare for the adoption of AI throughout the research lifecycle. Finally, a few examples will be presented of the initial attempts to apply AI-readiness principles to research in the social sciences and humanities at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. 2) Vanessa McBride, Director of Science, International Science Council: Launch of ISC Policy Primers on ‘Data for AI Science’, ‘Environmental Impact of AI’ and ‘Types of AI for Science’The International Science Council’s Centre for Science Futures has been gathering inputs from across the globe to assess how different science systems are preparing to harness the opportunities and mitigate the risks of artificial intelligence (AI) to science systems. Across these country case studies, from Chile to China, some common themes began to emerge. Two of these themes: the environmental impact of AI, and data for AI for science, have been explored in more depth in a set of primers written for a non-specialist, and possibly decision-making, audience. A third primer on the Types of AI in Science aims to provide a snapshot of terminologies, methods and example applications of AI in science. These primers will be launched at International Data Week, and we hope they will prove a useful starting point in translation between the scientific research communities and the policy-making communities as they navigate a rapidly evolving landscape in science. 3) Christine Kirkpatrick, Director of Research Data Services, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and CODATA Secretary General, and Tyng-Ruey Chuang, Associate Research Fellow at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan: CODATA White Paper ‘The role of data in AI for science’.Christine and Tyng-Ruey will discuss the CODATA Concept Paper on the role of data in AI for Science. The advance of science is a common enterprise. Scientific collaborations across national borders, research institutions, and academic disciplines are now a norm, facilitated in part by timely online dissemination of research publications and data. Data management is often a joint effort, as project teams work together in the production, curation, and reuse of research datasets. As research work is increasingly driven by data and computation, especially in the context of building prediction models from large datasets, there is an urgent need to articulate a principled approach to research data so as to sustain and advance science. The presentation will give a brief overview of the opportunities, challenges, and recommendations from the paper, as well as a perspective on redefining FAIR, for the AI age. 4) Slava Tykhonov, Head of AI and Interoperability, CODATA: ‘Semantic Croissant and CDIF for Responsible AI’This talk introduces Semantic Croissant, a knowledge-graph based extension of the CroissantML standard that links datasets with external resources such as ontologies and vocabularies, while also providing structure, resources, transformation rules and semantic context to enhance their usability for AI models. Built on schema.org, extended with Responsible AI fields, and enriched through linkage to multilingual controlled vocabularies and ontology alignment, it enables machine-readable discovery and validation of datasets. The Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) further extends Croissant ML with a variable cascade model that captures measurement units, attributes, properties, and inter-variable relationships. This approach ensures FAIR compliance and supports seamless integration across institutional boundaries, including the transformation of variables across disciplines and the documentation of scientific experiments.",
          "Society is experiencing the increasingly frequent and severe impacts of climate change and natural climate variability, and needs to prepare. In response to that, European (and non-European) research institutions, private companies, policymakers, funding bodies, and other stakeholders, are becoming more and more concerned about the importance of having quality climate information for supporting decision-making. In this sense, climate services are a key element for adaptation to and mitigation of anthropogenic climate change.Information relevant in the climate services field includes both quantitative data (e.g. measurements of climate variables, uncertainty, etc.) and qualitative data (e.g. stakeholders&amp;#8217; contexts, topics of interest, etc.). Qualitative data refers to non-numerical, descriptive data that captures information, characteristics, or attributes of a phenomenon, allowing for a deeper understanding of certain topics. The increased volume of available qualitative data, together with the advances in computational social sciences in the latest years, have revolutionized the way society is studied. Computational methods can assist in uncovering, for example, themes, patterns, insights, and relationships.This poster presents the application of a computational approach for the systematic identification, collection, storage, and analysis of social sciences data and information, in this case related to the field of climate services. The objective is to understand the current landscape of climate services in Europe, and the stakeholders involved, in order to build an equitable community encompassing providers and users of climate services.Various sources of information related to the provision of climate information and services exist. In this use case, we have focused on examining the EU-funded projects (number of projects, funding programmes and topics, participating institutions, etc.) related to climate services and climate information that are listed in CORDIS (the European Commission's platform on the results of projects funded by the EU's Research and Innovation framework programs).In addition to the methodology used, some preliminary results obtained from the analyses are shown, illustrating the evolution in the number of these projects, which has recently been growing, as well as the institutions involved by country and type of organization. We believe that these results can be a good indicator of the importance being given in Europe to climate services as tools to support communities, organizations, and institutions in adapting to climate change and variability.This is valuable information for the Climateurope2 project (which aims to support the community of climate services and develop recommendations for standardizing them) as it allows the identification of potential already existing projects and institutions that Climateurope2 could engage with. It also indicates where more emphasis needs to be placed on communicating the importance of climate services for decision-making.",
          "Scholarship in the African humanities—art history, cultural anthropology, history, literature, religion, and so forth—has transcended disciplinary ways of knowing, transformed scholarly conversations from a focus on difference between Africa and the West to an emphasis on connections and convergence, and emphasized the universality of the particular. Today, the African humanities must confront another limitation in scholarly discourse about Africa: the presentist priorities of schools of global studies. If it appears that claims to particularistic knowledge of social and historical processes and linguistic competence are falling on deaf ears, it may be because the logic of securing “America’s Place in the World,” the topic of the spring 2016 symposium in the School of Global and International Studies at Indiana University, no longer depends on knowledge of cultural processes produced by academics based in the university system. The United States moved on in the fall of 2014 from cultural tactics such as the Human Terrain Systems (HTS), developed by the US Army in 2006, to technical interventions like drones—interventions that do not rely on human sentiment or error, and big data like computational social sciences and predictive modeling (Gezari 2015). HTS embedded anthropologists (though the major scholarly association, the American Anthropological Association, rightly opposed HTS) and other social scientists with military units to provide regional expertise and cultural knowledge to aid military intelligence gathering and policymaking. In this new climate, dominated by technological solutions to social and political problems, largely managed by the Department of Defense, how can scholars of the African humanities based in the university system continue to make a case for the knowledge that we produce, which prioritizes humanistic understanding and humane values? It is these values, I argue, that foster public debate on the central issues of our time.",

          "This article introduces an interpretative approach to the analysis of situations in computational settings called situational analytics. I outline the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this approach, which is still under development, and show how it can be used to surface situations from large data sets derived from online platforms such as YouTube. Situational analytics extends to computationally-mediated settings a qualitative methodology developed by Adele Clarke, Situational Analysis (2005), which uses data mapping to detect heterogeneous entities in fieldwork data to determine ‘what makes a difference’ in a situation. Situational analytics scales up this methodology to analyse situations latent in computational data sets with semi-automated methods of textual and visual analysis. I discuss how this approach deviates from recent analyses of situations in computational social science, and argue that Clarke’s framework renders tractable a fundamental methodological problem that arises in this area of research: while social researchers turn to computational settings in order to analyse social life, the social processes unfolding in these envirnoments are fundamentally affected by the computational architectures in which they occur. Situational analytics offers a way to address this problematic by making a heterogeneously composed situation – involving social, technical and media elements – the unit of computational analysis. To conclude, I show how situational analytics can be applied in a case study of YouTube videos featuring intelligent vehicles and discuss how situational analysis itself needs to be elaborated if we are to come to terms with computational transformations of the situational fabric of social life.",
          "Abstract As machine learning (ML) algorithms get more sophisticated, ML enhances the role of theory in sociology. ML, despite its capacity to process data in complex ways, by definition only draws on limited representations of social systems. Humans have direct observational and experiential access to these systems, along with broad worldviews and tacit knowledge that make it possible to translate models of systems into knowledge of systems. The integration of the limited representational view of ML and the expansive human worldview is transforming sociological knowledge production. ML revitalizes theory in sociology in two key ways: by shifting the focus of theorizing from a priori to a posteriori and by necessitating ongoing interpretation and theorizing by scholars at every stage of the research process, thus integrating theory throughout research design. A creole computational social science can blend knowledge from multiple disciplines to enhance the knowledge-generating process overall.",
          "Abstract We are living in a golden age for social science—a time when researchers have both unprecedented access to human data and the computational power to interrogate those data. Innovation has proceeded with remarkable speed; new methods regularly deliver novel insights with increasingly improved accuracy. These data and tools have greatly impacted the social sciences by allowing researchers to ask new questions in meaningful, new ways and to revisit classic questions with renewed rigor. While computational capacity is no longer the insurmountable barrier it once was, the opportunity presented by this methodological innovation underscores the urgent need to address another long-standing limitation of scientific advancement: the relative homogeneity of the research community. Methodological pluralism—diversity of both methods and methodologists—is essential for ensuring the collective creativity necessary to fully leverage the tools and data available to researchers. How we ask and answer questions matters. How we conceive of questions, what data and tools we bring to those questions, and how we interpret our findings are all intimately interconnected with researcher perspectives and identities. If social science ultimately aims to understand the human experience, it cannot do so without full consideration for the diversity of that experience. This paper therefore details recent innovations in computational social science and machine learning, highlighting the connections between researcher perspectives, methodological choices, and data interpretation. With a particular focus on text and network methods, we illustrate the role of researcher choice in shaping scientific advancement and demonstrate the need for human interpretation of algorithmic output. By interrogating the role of human researchers in scientific discovery we showcase the value of methodological pluralism and argue that diversity is an essential and necessary condition for scientific advancement.",
          "The ascent of scaling in artificial intelligence research has revolutionized the field over the past decade, yet it presents significant challenges for academic researchers, particularly in computational social science and critical algorithm studies. The dominance of large language models, characterized by their extensive parameters and costly training processes, creates a disparity where only industry-affiliated researchers can access these resources. This imbalance restricts academic researchers from fully understanding their tools, leading to issues like reproducibility in computational social science and a reliance on black-box metaphors in critical studies. To address these challenges, we propose a \"tinkering\" approach that is inspired by existing works. This method involves engaging with smaller models or components that are manageable for ordinary researchers, fostering hands-on interaction with algorithms. We argue that tinkering is both a way of making and knowing for computational social science and a way of knowing for critical studies, and fundamentally, it is a way of caring that has broader implications for both fields.",
          "The Turing Test (TT) is a thought experiment establishing the existence of a unidirectional proof when applied to ascertain whether a machine has the capability to think, being endowed with artificial intelligence. As pointed out in recent works, however, the test is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the purpose for which it was intended. In addressing this issue, we propose an approach between the conceptual and empirical perspective of TT. First, we define what an intelligent machine is by taking into account human behaviors related to decision-making. Then, motivated by recent applications of the reverse Turing test in science, we schematize a possible reversal of the test suitable for coping with emerging, value-based decisions involving intelligent machines. In the wake of this reversal, two applications are given as examples: The first concerns the ethical sphere and stems from any lack of integrity and thoroughness as well as the inconsistency of users of intelligent machines; while the second is represented by inducing individual, organizational, and structural changes in the socio-economic system. In this regard, we argue that a relationally focused approach takes seriously questions of Turing's endeavors, while also making space for constructive criticism, and might be actually established by integrating artificial intelligence with other cognitive sciences and, nevertheless, with computational social science and digital humanities.",
          "Computational developments--particularly artificial intelligence--are reshaping social scientific research and raise new questions for in-depth methods such as ethnography and qualitative interviewing. Building on classic debates about computers in qualitative data analysis (QDA), we revisit possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, and 'big data.' We introduce a typology of contemporary approaches to using computers in qualitative research: streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical methods, the sociology of computation, and technological rejection. Drawing from scaled team ethnographies and solo research integrating computational social science (CSS), we describe methodological choices across study lifecycles, from literature reviews through data collection, coding, text retrieval, and representation. We argue that new technologies hold potential to address longstanding methodological challenges when deployed with knowledge, purpose, and ethical commitment. Yet a pragmatic approach--moving beyond technological optimism and dismissal--is essential given rapidly changing tools that are both generative and dangerous. Computation now saturates research infrastructure, from algorithmic literature searches to scholarly metrics, making computational literacy a core methodological competence in and beyond sociology. We conclude that when used carefully and transparently, contemporary computational tools can meaningfully expand--rather than displace--the irreducible insights of qualitative research.",
          "The future of society by the 2050s will be technology-driven with AI at its core, and IoT is about sensors embedded into the gadgets which then offer streams of data through Internet connectivity. The emergence of AI and computational social sciences will gain relevance as massive datasets of all kinds of human behaviour are now available in e-forms. The fact remains that AI cannot solve unknown problems when such problems are culturally determined. The scope of anthropological concepts, theories, and methodology falls well within the assertion of balanced development, and the present chapter deals with these issues focusing on ethnographic approaches in AI construction. This development will accelerate the digital transformation of industries.",

While the initial quality of analysis may be limited, the idea of rapid probing allows scholars to explore how the analysis fits in an actual workflow on the target text data and it can thus provide early feedback for the process of refining the modeling. If the rapid probing method can indeed be incorporated in a hermeneutic framework to the satisfaction of well-disposed Humanities scholars, a swifter exploration of alternative paths of analysis would become possible. This may generate considerable additional momentum for transdisciplinary integration. It is as yet too early to point to truly Humanities-oriented examples of the proposed rapid probing technique. To nevertheless make the programmatic idea more concrete, the article uses two experimental scenarios to argue how rapid probing might help addressing the scheduling dilemma and the subjectivity problem respectively. The first scenario illustrates the transfer of complex analysis pipelines across corpora; the second one addresses rapid annotation experiments targeting character mentions in literary text.",
          "Computational developments--particularly artificial intelligence--are reshaping social scientific research and raise new questions for in-depth methods such as ethnography and qualitative interviewing. Building on classic debates about computers in qualitative data analysis (QDA), we revisit possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, and 'big data.' We introduce a typology of contemporary approaches to using computers in qualitative research: streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical methods, the sociology of computation, and technological rejection. Drawing from scaled team ethnographies and solo research integrating computational social science (CSS), we describe methodological choices across study lifecycles, from literature reviews through data collection, coding, text retrieval, and representation. We argue that new technologies hold potential to address longstanding methodological challenges when deployed with knowledge, purpose, and ethical commitment. Yet a pragmatic approach--moving beyond technological optimism and dismissal--is essential given rapidly changing tools that are both generative and dangerous. Computation now saturates research infrastructure, from algorithmic literature searches to scholarly metrics, making computational literacy a core methodological competence in and beyond sociology. We conclude that when used carefully and transparently, contemporary computational tools can meaningfully expand--rather than displace--the irreducible insights of qualitative research.",
          "Abstract Data wrangling is typically treated as an obligatory, codified, and ideally automated step in machine learning that transforms qualities into quantities and quantities into algorithmic inputs. In contrast, this chapter proposes a different perspective, suggesting that archival data wrangling is a theory-driven process best understood as a practical craft. The chapter draws on empirical examples from contemporary computational social science to identify nine core modes of data wrangling: noticing, accessing, filtering, assembling, weaving, casting, visualizing, retracing, and prospecting. These modes, while presented as sequential, are actually iterative and nonlinear in practice. Treating data wrangling as a craft allows researchers to practice reflexivity in a process that is inherently political. Archival evidence and analytical methods can propagate enduring institutional biases if left unchecked. To this end, the chapter also discusses how data wrangling can help address issues of coded bias in scholarly research and beyond. While contemporary machine learning focuses on architectural engineering, a thorough engagement with it requires a deep of understanding of data wrangling.",

          "Ethnography (social scientific methods that illuminate how people understand, navigate and shape the real world contexts in which they live their lives) and machine learning (computational techniques that use big data and statistical learning models to perform quantifiable tasks) are each core to contemporary social science. Yet these tools have remained largely separate in practice. This chapter draws on a growing body of scholarship that argues that ethnography and machine learning can be usefully combined, particularly for large comparative studies. Specifically, this paper (a) explains the value (and challenges) of using machine learning alongside qualitative field research for certain types of projects, (b) discusses recent methodological trends to this effect, (c) provides examples that illustrate workflow drawn from several large projects, and (d) concludes with a roadmap for enabling productive coevolution of field methods and machine learning.Keywordsethnography, computational social science, qualitative methods, machine learning, natural language processing, large language models, computational ethnography, digital ethnography, big data, research methods, mixed-methods",

The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes.

          "Abstract Machine learning, renowned for its ability to detect patterns in large datasets, has seen a significant increase in applications and complexity since the early decades of the 21st century. The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of Machine Learning offers a state-of-the-art and forward-looking overview of the intersection between machine learning and sociology, exploring what sociology can gain from machine learning and how it can shed new light on the societal implications of this technology. Through its 39 chapters, an international group of sociologists address three key questions. First, what can sociologists yield from using machine learning as a methodological tool? This question is examined across various data types, including text, images, and sound, and insights are provided about how machine learning and ethnography can be combined. Second, how is machine learning being used throughout society, and what are its consequences? The Handbook explores this question by examining the assumptions and infrastructures behind machine learning applications as well as the biases they might perpetuate. Themes include art, cities, expertise, financial markets, gender, race, intersectionality, law enforcement, medicine, and the environment and cover contexts across the Global South and Global North. Third, what does machine learning mean for sociological theory and theorizing? Chapters examine this question through discussions on agency, culture, human–machine interaction, influence, meaning, power dynamics, prediction, and postcolonial perspectives. The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of Machine Learning is an essential resource for academics and students interested in artificial intelligence, computational social science, and the role and implications of machine learning in society.",
          "Novel digital data sources and tools like machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to revolutionize data about development and can contribute to monitoring and mitigating humanitarian problems. The potential of applying novel technologies to solving some of humanity's most pressing issues has garnered interest outside the traditional disciplines studying and working on international development. Today, scientific communities in fields like Computational Social Science, Network Science, Complex Systems, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, and the broader AI field are increasingly starting to pay attention to these pressing issues. However, are sophisticated data driven tools ready to be used for solving real-world problems with imperfect data and of staggering complexity? We outline the current state-of-the-art and identify barriers, which need to be surmounted in order for data-driven technologies to become useful in humanitarian and development contexts. We argue that, without organized and purposeful efforts, these new technologies risk at best falling short of promised goals, at worst they can increase inequality, amplify discrimination, and infringe upon human rights.",

          "Machine learning (ML) represents a key link to both data analytics and human–robot interaction. ML in society is a topic of central relevance to computational social science because ML changes both the object and methods of social science. This chapter questions the view that this change implies a shift from error-prone survey data to error-free behavioral data. It draws attention to a possible distorting factor in the latter case, the use of techniques that guard Internet users against being tracked when surfing the web. Data from a local population survey are used to explore supposed sources of variation of such techniques in practice. The analysis reveals three such sources: open-mindedness towards technical innovation, comparative risk perception, and the felt ease with human–robot interaction scenarios and related attitudes towards robots and AI. The chapter uses data from two surveys of the Bremen AI Delphi study on the social and ethical acceptance of robots and artificial intelligence.",
          "This session explored cutting edge developments in relation to AI for Science and, in particular, AI and Data. AI offers groundbreaking opportunities and poses numerous challenges regarding the reproducibility of science and the conduct of scientists. How do we prepare AI-ready data, build and use specialized AI models, while establishing ground truths and a new form of explainability? What response is necessary from science policy makers, leaders, and decision makers? The session will include a discussion of the essential scientific response to AI developments from various perspectives, including those of scientists and AI specialists, and of policy makers. The session will also feature the launch of ISC Policy Primers and the CODATA White Paper on the Role of Data in AI for Science. The presentations will be followed by structured discussion and audience involvement. Chair: Simon Hodson, CODATA Executive Director Speakers: 1) Mercè Crosas, Director of Computational Social Science, Barcelona Supercomputing Center and CODATA President: ‘Becoming AI-ready in Science’. Mercè will open the session and describe the landscape of AI developments in scientific research, highlighting the steps needed to use, modify, or develop AI models in science without compromising rigor and open science principles. The talk will include a discussion of the best practices and standards that need to be extended to help domain scientists and research/AI engineers prepare for the adoption of AI throughout the research lifecycle. Finally, a few examples will be presented of the initial attempts to apply AI-readiness principles to research in the social sciences and humanities at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. 2) Vanessa McBride, Director of Science, International Science Council: Launch of ISC Policy Primers on ‘Data for AI Science’, ‘Environmental Impact of AI’ and ‘Types of AI for Science’The International Science Council’s Centre for Science Futures has been gathering inputs from across the globe to assess how different science systems are preparing to harness the opportunities and mitigate the risks of artificial intelligence (AI) to science systems. Across these country case studies, from Chile to China, some common themes began to emerge. Two of these themes: the environmental impact of AI, and data for AI for science, have been explored in more depth in a set of primers written for a non-specialist, and possibly decision-making, audience. A third primer on the Types of AI in Science aims to provide a snapshot of terminologies, methods and example applications of AI in science. These primers will be launched at International Data Week, and we hope they will prove a useful starting point in translation between the scientific research communities and the policy-making communities as they navigate a rapidly evolving landscape in science. 3) Christine Kirkpatrick, Director of Research Data Services, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and CODATA Secretary General, and Tyng-Ruey Chuang, Associate Research Fellow at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan: CODATA White Paper ‘The role of data in AI for science’.Christine and Tyng-Ruey will discuss the CODATA Concept Paper on the role of data in AI for Science. The advance of science is a common enterprise. Scientific collaborations across national borders, research institutions, and academic disciplines are now a norm, facilitated in part by timely online dissemination of research publications and data. Data management is often a joint effort, as project teams work together in the production, curation, and reuse of research datasets. As research work is increasingly driven by data and computation, especially in the context of building prediction models from large datasets, there is an urgent need to articulate a principled approach to research data so as to sustain and advance science. The presentation will give a brief overview of the opportunities, challenges, and recommendations from the paper, as well as a perspective on redefining FAIR, for the AI age. 4) Slava Tykhonov, Head of AI and Interoperability, CODATA: ‘Semantic Croissant and CDIF for Responsible AI’This talk introduces Semantic Croissant, a knowledge-graph based extension of the CroissantML standard that links datasets with external resources such as ontologies and vocabularies, while also providing structure, resources, transformation rules and semantic context to enhance their usability for AI models. Built on schema.org, extended with Responsible AI fields, and enriched through linkage to multilingual controlled vocabularies and ontology alignment, it enables machine-readable discovery and validation of datasets. The Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) further extends Croissant ML with a variable cascade model that captures measurement units, attributes, properties, and inter-variable relationships. This approach ensures FAIR compliance and supports seamless integration across institutional boundaries, including the transformation of variables across disciplines and the documentation of scientific experiments.",

          "As belief around the potential of computational social science grows, fuelled by recent advances in machine learning, data scientists are ostensibly becoming the new experts in education. Scholars engaged in critical studies of education and technology have sought to interrogate the growing datafication of education yet tend not to use computational methods as part of this response. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of the use of computational approaches as part of a critical research agenda. Presenting and reflecting upon two examples of projects that use computational methods in education to explore questions of equity and justice, we suggest that such approaches might help expand the capacity of critical researchers to highlight existing inequalities, make visible possible approaches for beginning to address such inequalities, and engage marginalised communities in designing and ultimately deploying these possibilities. Drawing upon work within the fields of Critical Data Studies and Science and Technology Studies, we further reflect on the two cases to discuss the possibilities and challenges of reimagining computational methods for critical research in education and technology, focusing on six areas of consideration: criticality, philosophy, inclusivity, context, classification, and responsibility.",
          "Abstract This paper aims at exploring the dynamic interplay between advanced technological developments in AI and Big Data and the sustained relevance of theoretical frameworks in scientific inquiry. It questions whether the abundance of data in the AI era reduces the necessity for theory or, conversely, enhances its importance. Arguing for a synergistic approach, the paper emphasizes the need for integrating computational capabilities with theoretical insight to uncover deeper truths within extensive datasets. The discussion extends into computational social science, where elements from sociology, psychology, and economics converge. The application of these interdisciplinary theories in the context of AI is critically examined, highlighting the need for methodological diversity and addressing the ethical implications of AI-driven research. The paper concludes by identifying future trends and challenges in AI and computational social science, offering a call to action for the scientific community, policymakers, and society. Being positioned at the intersection of AI, data science, and social theory, this paper illuminates the complexities of our digital era and inspires a re-evaluation of the methodologies and ethics guiding our pursuit of knowledge.",
          "This chapter chronicles and reflects on the experiences of working ethnographically within, alongside and in collaboration with a large-scale interdisciplinary experiment in computational social science. It does so by recounting, from the ethnographer's point of view, a number of 'collaborative moments' at the awkward intersection of computational data science and ethnographic fieldwork, as partners in the same research project. Here, the anthropologist finds herself in a position at right angles to both the population under study and the other scientists studying them; a chronic condition of oscillating between practising ethnography in a (partly) computational social science framework and doing an ethnography of the very scientific data practices and infrastructures involved. We consider this in/of oscillation not as a point of disciplinary comparison but rather as involving 'transversal' collaborations that instantiate forms of non-coherent, intermittent and yet productively mutual co-shaping among partially connected knowledge practices and practitioners. Such a rethinking is crucial, we argue, for understanding new social data 'complementarities' and their epistemological, ethical and political ramifications.",

          "Society faces an increasing number of problems whose scale and complexity are growing exponentially (e.g. global warming, global health crisis/pandemic, food distribution etc.). The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise to help us bring together the knowledge and associated action to solve them. However, our ability to tap into the distributed creative potential of humans and AI necessarily involves figuring out how to make them work together as a collective. In this symposium, we bring together diverse perspectives from cross-disciplinary scholars attacking this problem using diverse theoretical lenses and research methods. Together these five papers (qualitative, computational, empirical, and theoretical) create an opportunity to discuss multiple ways for leveraging AI for augmenting individual cognition, interactive processes, and collective functioning. Our goal is to provoke discussion at the intersection of computational social science, complexity sciences, information science, and management science to stimulate progress toward the human-AI systems that provide the greatest hope of solving the major problems threatening humanity.

          "With the support of artificial intelligence (AI), the smart applications in all walks of life have brought great changes to human society. Not only being concerned, analysed and criticized by scholars from Humanities and social sciences, AI also plays an important role in empirical research methods, thus facilitating the transformation of research paradigms in these fields. At present, neuro-symbolic AI, as a new product of the integration of two major factions in the field of artificial intelligence - connectionism and symbolism, has high application value in studying and solving the humanistic and social problems involving massive data due to its learning capability of perceiving the environment as well as reasoning capability of manipulating symbols. The introduction of neuro-symbolic AI is also of great significance for the development of emerging interdisciplinary fields such as digital humanities and computational social sciences. This paper aims to clarify the connections between neuro-symbolic AI and Humanities and social sciences, summarize the latest developing trends and representative applications, and explore a feasible path for the expansion of pluralistic methodologies in Humanities and social sciences to adapt to the age of big data.",

          "This article reflects on the paradox that although research using qualitative interviews has developed sophisticated repertoires of data collection, it has not fully embraced secondary analysis and has struggled to address questions of representativeness. This contrasts with quantitative social science where this is now routine. We discuss recent innovations associated with the ‘big qual’ approach to assembling data from existing qualitative interview studies but argue for a development that champions secondary analysis of qualitative interview data collected from larger, more representative samples. We reflect on precedents for this approach from the 1958 British Birth Cohort Study and, more recently, the American Voices Project. We draw out the unrealised possibilities of secondary analysis, enhanced by recent affordances of computational social science. We argue that the wider deployment of secondary analysis will expand the appeal of qualitative research for policy audiences and contest the hegemony of quantitative survey analysis.",

          "Mechatronics and Robotics (MaR) have recently gained importance in product development and manufacturing settings and applications. Therefore, the Center for Space Emerging Technologies (C-SET) has managed an international multi-disciplinary study to present, historically, the first Latin American general review of industrial, collaborative, and mobile robotics, with the support of North American and European researchers and institutions. The methodology is developed by considering literature extracted from Scopus, Web of Science, and Aerospace Research Central and adding reports written by companies and government organizations. This describes the state-of-the-art of MaR until the year 2023 in the 3 Sub-Regions: North America, Central America, and South America, having achieved important results related to the academy, industry, government, and entrepreneurship; thus, the statistics shown in this manuscript are unique. Also, this article explores the potential for further work and advantages described by robotic companies such as ABB, KUKA, and Mecademic and the use of the Robot Operating System (ROS) in order to promote research, development, and innovation. In addition, the integration with industry 4.0 and digital manufacturing, architecture and construction, aerospace, smart agriculture, artificial intelligence, and computational social science (human-robot interaction) is analyzed to show the promising features of these growing tech areas, considering the improvements to increase production, manufacturing, and education in the Region. Finally, regarding the information presented, Latin America is considered an important location for investments to increase production and product development, taking into account the further proposal for the creation of the LATAM Consortium for Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics, which could support and work on roboethics and education/R+D+I law and regulations in the Region.

          "Presentations from the SSHOC Webinar \"Quanlify with ease: Combining quantitative and qualitative corpus analysis\" (16 April 2020), by Andreas Blaette. <strong>There are many reasons why researchers in the humanities and the social sciences want to combine the <em>quantitative</em>, data-driven and algorithmic analysis of text with <em>qualitative</em> inspection, hermeneutic approaches and interpretation. One important reason is to attain intersubjectivity and to warrant the validity of findings.</strong> Indeed, there are technological solutions for “quanlification” (validation of quantitative findings through qualitative means). Such approaches, however, are mostly integrated software solutions, local or server-based, that strongly limit possibilities to develop, test and deploy new workflows. During this webinar, Andreas Blätte, professor of Public Policy and Regional Politics at the University of Duisburg-Essen, discussed the idea and the implementation of “quanlify”, a framework currently under development in the PolMine Project, which is implemented in the statistical programming language R. The package pursues a strongly modular design that would enable R users with intermediate skills to flexibly combine elements of workflows that comprise quantitative and qualitative features into comprehensible code, handy GUIs or interactive dashboards that can be used on- and offline. <strong>ABOUT THE WEBINAR SPEAKER</strong> Andreas Blätte is a professor of Public Policy and Regional Politics at the University of Duisburg-Essen. He is a political scientist by training, but has developed a strong interest in data and analytical tools for using corpora in the social sciences and the humanities. He has published three R packages (polmineR, RcppCWB and cwbtools) that are available via CRAN. His prime substantial research interest is the discursive dimension of migration and integration policy. <strong>ABOUT THE WEBINAR HOST</strong> Christoph Leonhardt works as a research associate at the Institute of Political Science of the University of Duisburg-Essen. Aside from the creation of language resources, his current research interests include the relationship between political discourse and institutional change, in particular combining perspectives of Political Science and Computational Social Science."

          "During the last 15 years there has been an explosion in human behavioral data caused by the emergence of cheap electronics and online platforms. This has spawned a whole new research field called computational social science, which has a quantitative approach to the study of human behavior. Most studies have considered data sets with just one behavioral variable such as email communication. The Social Fabric interdisciplinary research project is an attempt to collect a more complete data set on human behavior by providing 1000 smartphones with pre-installed data collection software to students at the Technical University of Denmark. The data set includes face-to-face interaction (Bluetooth), communication (calls and texts), mobility (GPS), social network (Facebook), and general background information including a psychological profile (questionnaire). This thesis presents my work on the Social Fabric data set, along with work on other behavioral data. The overall goal is to contribute to a quantitative understanding of human behavior using big data and mathematical models. Central to the thesis is the determination of the predictability of different human activities. Upper limits are derived for communication, movement, and social proximity, along with upper limits on the predictability of the spatial dynamics. Furthermore, it is shown that different human activities have a strong impact on each other and that human activity patterns follow a general linear principle throughout the population. It is found that the type and strength of an interaction impacts the tendency for the interaction to take place in a relation formed by two similar individuals. It is furthermore shown that most relations are asymmetric in the sense that one part initiates communication much more often than the other. Evidence is provided, which implies that the asymmetry is caused by a self-enhancement in the initiation dynamics. These results have implications for the formation of social networks and the dynamics of the links. It is shown that the Big Five Inventory (BFI) representing a psychological profile only correlates weakly with the behavioral variables collected by the smartphone. In particular, the BFI almost does not impact our choice of friends, our interaction patterns, and our mobility patterns. The extraversion variable provides the only exception to this rule. The dynamics of online attention on Twitter is studied and the underlying stochastic dynamics is derived under a Markovian assumption. Finally, it is studied how the occurrence of new aircraft incidents influence the memory of old aircraft incidents on Wikipedia. New incidents are found to trigger a large flow of attention to old incidents, thereby implying that interactions between spreading processes are driving forces of attention dynamics. Overall, the thesis contributes to a quantitative understanding of a wide range of different human behaviors by applying mathematical modeling to behavioral data. There can be no doubt that such mathematical models can have great predictive power, but obviously there are also limitations.",
          "To understand and manage complex organizations, we must develop tools capable of measuring human social interaction accurately and uniformly. Current technologies that measure face-to-face communication do not measure interaction in a unified manner and often ignore remote interaction, an increasingly common communication modality. In this article we present Rhythm, a platform that combines wearable electronic badges and online applications to capture team-level and network-level interaction patterns in organizations. The platform measures conversation time, turn-taking behavior, and the physical proximity of both co-located and distributed members. Our goal is to empower organizations and researchers to measure formal and informal social interaction across teams, divisions, and locations. We describe two pilot studies that use this platform and discuss how measurement systems like Rhythm may further the fields of computational social science and organizational design.",
          "The ways in which people communicate and keep in touch with each other are changing. Our relationships are shaped by the wide variety of communication possibilities available, and the overall increase in mediated communication. On the other hand, the relationships also shape the use of different means of communication. Since the proliferation of mobile phones, mobile voice calls and SMSs have become the world’s most ubiquitous form of mediated communication. More recently also newer mobile communication services have emerged, which are not necessarily provided by mobile operators, but based on the Internet instead. The merger of the mobile and Internet domains is further accelerating the changes in how we socialize.&#13;\\nThe purpose of this thesis is to empirically analyze the use of mobile interpersonal communication services by using a quantitatively driven mixed method design, with handset-based measurements as the core data collection method. The aim is to fill in the research gap of sparse objective user-level research on mobile communication service usage. Handset-based measurements enable collecting actual mobile phone usage data from users who have opted in to participate and install a research application to their devices. Because of the personal and social “always on” nature of the data collection device, we are able to collect rich location-based and context-sensitive data about how mobile communication services are used. The main data analyzed are collected from up to 200 participants from a longitudinal research panel with a span of more than a year. In addition to handset-based measurements, surveys and semi-structured interviews are used as complementary methods.&#13;\\nIn this thesis mobile communication services are found to be used differently based on a number of factors. Mobile phone use context and the strength of the tie between the persons communicating are the most salient ones. For example, SMSs are used more with strong ties when compared to voice calls. Moreover, the lengthiest and the briefest voice calls are made in the Home and Office contexts, respectively. Consequently, the usage interrelationships of mobile communication services are discussed from a mobile operator perspective. The use of multiple and dynamic datasets in social network analysis is also encouraged, as the analysis of different communication channels may or may not lead to different views of the social network under analysis. Thus, the thesis and the results of the research can be valuable for practitioners and academics in the area of mobile ecosystems, particularly mobile operators. The thesis also contributes to the emerging fields of communication and social network research, namely computational social science and social computing.",
          "The widespread adoption of smartphones with advanced sensing, computing and data transfer capabilities has made scientific studies of human social behavior possible at a previously unprecedented scale. It has also allowed context-awareness to become a natural feature in many applications using features such as activity recognition and location information. However, one of the most important aspects of context remains largely untapped at scale, i.e. social interactions and social context. Social interaction sensing has been explored using smartphones and specialized hardware for research purposes within computational social science and ubiquitous computing, but several obstacles remain to make it usable in practice by applications at industrial scale. In this thesis, I explore methods of physical proximity sensing and extraction of social context information from user-generated data for the purpose of context-aware applications. Furthermore, I explore the application space made possible through these methods, especially in the class of use cases that are characterized by embodied social agency, through field studies and a case study.A major concern when collecting context information is the impact on user privacy. I have performed a user study in which I have surveyed the user attitudes towards the privacy implications of proximity sensing. Finally, I present results from quantitatively estimating the sensitivity of a simple type of context information, i.e. application usage, in terms of risk of user re-identification.",
          "ABSTRACT With the growth in sensing devices, data logging capabilities and multi‐sensory presentation interfaces, it has been argued that the future of documents is “multisensory, pervasive, and immersive,” and building an agenda around these themes is critical for future information science research. Hence, in this panel, we bring together an international group of researchers actively engaged in research at the intersection of sensors and information science. The panel will discuss the new research opportunities and challenges afforded by the use of different kinds of sensors (e.g., fitness trackers, phones, cameras, fMRIs) for information science research. The panel aims to raise awareness and catalyze a strong research activity on sensor‐enriched information science, which is expected to have multiple implications for human information behavior, health informatics, neuro‐information science, data science, social informatics and computational social science.",
          "The vast availability of mobile phones with built-in movement and location sensors enable the collection of detailed information about human movement even indoors. As mobility is a key element of many processes and activities, an interesting class of information to extract is movement patterns that quantify how humans move, interact and group. In this paper we propose methods for detecting two common pedestrian movement patterns, namely individual following relations and group leadership. The proposed methods for identifying following patterns employ machine learning on features derived using similarity analysis on time lagged sequences of WiFi measurements containing either raw signal strength values or derived locations. To detect leadership we combine the individual following relations into directed graphs and detect leadership within groups by graph link analysis. Methods for detecting these movement patterns open up new possibilities in - amongst others - computational social science, reality mining, marketing research and location-based gaming. We provide evaluation results that show error rates down to 7%, improving over state of the art methods with up to eleven percentage points for following patterns and up to twenty percentage points for leadership patterns. Our method is, contrary to state of the art, also applicable in challenging indoor environments, e.g., multi-story buildings. This implies that even quite small samples allow us to detect information such as how events and campaigns in multistory shopping malls may trigger following in small groups, or which group members typically take the lead when triggered by e.g. commercials, or how rescue or police forces act during training exercises.",
          "Understanding both collective and personal human mobility is a central topic in Computational Social Science. Smartphone sensing data is emerging as a promising source for studying human mobility. However, most literature focuses on high-precision GPS positioning and high-frequency sampling, which is not always feasible in a longitudinal study or for everyday applications because location sensing has a high battery cost. In this paper we study the feasibility of inferring human mobility from sparse, low accuracy mobile sensing data. We validate our results using participants' location diaries, and analyze the inferred geographical networks, the time spent at different places, and the number of unique places over time. Our results suggest that low resolution data allows accurate inference of human mobility patterns.",
          "With the development of programmable computers, humans have entered the digital age. The emergence of the World Wide Web and the ubiquity of computers, mobile phones, and other devices that automatically store digital records has led to the concept of big data. To harness this big data, new computational tools and methods are constantly being created to extract information from it. When people interact with digital devices and platforms, they leave digital footprints. These traces can open a window into understanding the behavioral patterns of humans. The emerging multi-disciplinary field of computational social science takes advantage of the large, empirical datasets built of these footprints and uses them to address questions from various fields of social sciences by applying methods and techniques from hard sciences like physics and network science. In the past decade, there has been a surge of studies where such datasets have been used to study human patterns of behavior. Many have looked at structural properties of social networks such as personal network sizes or tie strengths. A more recent trend focuses on temporal features of human behavior and communication. In this thesis, multiple datasets of digital activity have been analyzed. These data are of various types, from communication timestamps to sociodemographic data. The main focus of this work is to understand temporal patterns of human behavior, such as daily and weekly patterns of communication, as well as patterns of mobile phone usage, which can be seen as proxies of times of sleep and wakefulness. Looking at these different rhythms, we find that individuals exhibit activity patterns which are unique to each person and they tend to maintain their signature activity pattern over time. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nBased on their propensity to sleep at different hours of the day, people can be categorized into groups called chronotypes. By analyzing the phone usage activity, we infer their Chronotype and find that individuals with different chronotypes vary in the features of their personal social network, such as the number of their contacts. For example, we see that evening-active individuals maintain larger networks. Also, by looking at the social network of study participants we observe that evening-active people tend to be more central in the network. They also exhibit homophily, which is absent for morning-active individuals. &#13;\\n&#13;\\nRecently, much effort has been made to design studies which combine different devices and data sources to collect data from individuals with the goal of addressing specific questions and trying to tackle societal challenges such as the spread of diseases or issues of mental health. We have worked in a multi-disciplinary group to design a prototype data collection platform, which is currently being used for projects ranging from mental health to neuroscience studies.",
          "We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel human encounter detection framework for measuring and analysing human behaviour in social settings. We propose the use of WiFi probes, management frames of WiFi, that periodically radiate from mobile devices (as proxies for humans), and existing WiFi access points to automatically capture radio signals and detect human copresence. Based on the spatio-temporal properties of this copresence and their interplay we defined a model, borrowing theories from sociology, to detect human encounters -- short-lived, spontaneous human interactions. We evaluated our framework using controlled and in-the-wild experiments yielding a detection performance of 96% and 86% respectively. As such, our framework opens up interesting opportunities for designing proxemic and group applications, as well as conducting large-scale studies in the areas of computational social sciences.",
          "The blend of topics in computational social science enhances the research complexity in developing efficient computational social systems (CSSs). Electronic health (E-health) is a critical branch of CSS. Artificial intelligence-based cognitive computing is especially appropriate for solving E-health problems in social science. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies is triggering data explosion in E-health CSS. The IoT-based edge computing has been applied in the field of E-health to reduce the latency of data transmission. However, small edge devices have limited resources (e.g., computational and storage resources). There is an urgent need to develop lightweight and efficient classification models to classify E-health sensor data in edge computing. Automatic health sensor data classification can help medical workers make correct clinical decisions. Also, patient-specific modeling in E-health is important. Using personalized classification model can achieve higher diagnose accuracy than the generic models trained based on historical datasets. To address the above problems, we propose a lightweight personalized sensor data classification model, called LPClass. It embeds the shallow recurrent neural network as a kernel, which makes it lightweight enough to be deployed on edge devices. In addition, a transfer learning algorithm is proposed to build personalized models for individuals. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LPClass from different aspects. Compared with the generic models, the personalized models in LPClass can achieve a fast convergence rate while maintaining high classification accuracy.",
          "A warm welcome to the First ACM Workshop on Mobile Systems for Computational Social Science (MCSS'12) co-located with MobiSys'12. We are very excited to introduce you to the technical program of our workshop, which includes 7 papers, representing high-quality research conducted over a broad spectrum of topics related to mobile systems and computational social science. Each paper was reviewed by three members of our Technical Program Committee. For decades, behavioral scientists have struggled to understand the various factors that influence behavior. Observational and self-report methods have shed some light on those factors, but the nature of such methods can elicit responses that are not always completely accurate. Furthermore, such methods usually capture behavior as it occurs in a laboratory as opposed to behavior as it naturally occurs in everyday life. Recent advances in mobile technology provide some extremely powerful tools for overcoming these obstacles. Indeed, mobile phones represent an ideal platform for studying behavior and interactions in real-life contexts. There are many open challenges in terms of system design: for instance, since mobile phones are battery powered, efficient algorithms have to be developed to derive accurate inferences from sensor data, and cloud resources can be exploited to support complex computations. Given their diffusion, mobile phones allow to develop systems at scale, i.e., supporting mobile applications potentially used by millions of people at the same time. Data collected by means of mobile phones can then be used for analysis of human behavior and interactions. There are also many challenges in this area, especially related to the management of personal data and real-time processing of information. Mobile systems will represent a key foundational component of the emerging discipline of computational social science. We really hope that this workshop will be an opportunity to build a community around these themes. The workshop program has been structured into three technical sessions, namely, Social Sciences and Mobile Systems, Algorithms and Techniques for Computational Social Science and Applications and Deployments. Moreover, we organized two invited keynote sessions and a poster and demonstration session.",

          "A growing portion of offline and online human activities leave digital footprints in electronic databases. Resulting big social data offers unprecedented insights into population-wide patterns and detailed characteristics of the individuals. The goal of this paper is to review the literature showing how pervasive records of digital footprints, such as Facebook profile, or mobile device logs, can be used to infer personality, a major psychological framework describing differences in individual behavior. We briefly introduce personality and present a range of works focusing on predicting it from digital footprints and conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results in terms of privacy, data ownership, and opportunities for future research in computational social science.",
          "Abstract Android and iPhone devices account for over 90 percent of all smartphones sold worldwide. Despite being very similar in functionality, current discourse and marketing campaigns suggest that key individual differences exist between users of these two devices; however, this has never been investigated empirically. This is surprising, as smartphones continue to gain momentum across a variety of research disciplines. In this article, we consider if individual differences exist between these two distinct groups. In comparison to Android users, we found that iPhone owners are more likely to be female, younger, and increasingly concerned about their smartphone being viewed as a status object. Key differences in personality were also observed with iPhone users displaying lower levels of Honesty–Humility and higher levels of emotionality. Following this analysis, we were also able to build and test a model that predicted smartphone ownership at above chance level based on these individual differences. In line with extended self-theory, the type of smartphone owned provides some valuable information about its owner. These findings have implications for the increasing use of smartphones within research particularly for those working within Computational Social Science and PsychoInformatics , where data are typically collected from devices and applications running a single smartphone operating system.",
          "Mobile devices and services are becoming an inseparable part of the human life. These devices and services are used for communication, information retrieval, entertainment and much more. The additional value, as well as the challenges in the mobile services domain relate to its ubiquitous, or the \"anywhere, anytime\" properties. The convenience and constant accessibility of services available within arm's reach of the consumer is a compelling value proposition. On the other hand, the usage situations vary and the users have varying needs and possibilities in different situations. This variation calls for understanding the user behavior and the services to dynamically adapt to the users' situations. Context refers to any information that can be used to characterize the situation of the user, and thus the utilization of context is considered relevant to building better and more personalized mobile services.&#13;\\nThe purpose of this thesis is to study how to acquire and utilize information on the use context of a mobile end user from handset-based measurements and find out what general and contextual mobile device and service usage patterns the measurements reveal. The aim is to fill in a research gap in the intersection of small-scale empirical context-awareness research and market level mobile service usage research by leveraging the user-level, yet scalable nature of handset-based measurements. Handset-based measurements enable the collection of objective real life data on the usage of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, of opted-in study participants. In addition to handset-based measurements, surveys and network measurements were used as complementary methods.&#13;\\nMechanisms behind the observed mobile devices and services related user behavior are complex. In this thesis the general level mobile device and service usage is identified as communication and Web browsing oriented, occurring in bursts of activity and dominated by relatively short sessions. In addition, the usage varies between certain contexts. For example, the general home usage shows long but more infrequent usage sessions in comparison to other studied semantic places. The contextual results are, however, rather service specific. Finally, the largest variation is observed between users, with, for example, two magnitude differences in device usage intensity between light and heavy users. The results emphasize the need for personalized mobile services. The data collection capabilities of contemporary mobile devices enable diverse contextual information utilization for increasing the level of service personalization, for instance. Additionally, mobile devices provide more accurate tools for the more general human behavior research in the spirit of computational social science.",
          "As \"Big Data\" has become pervasive, an increasing amount of research has connected the dots between human behaviour in the offline and online worlds. Consequently, researchers have exploited these new findings to create models that better predict different aspects of human life and recommend future behaviour. To date, however, we do not yet fully understand the similarities and differences of human behaviour in these virtual and physical worlds. Here, we analyse and discuss the mobility and application usage of 400,000 individuals over eight months. We find an astonishing similarity between people's mobility in the physical space and how they move from app to app in smartphones. Our data shows that individuals use and visit a finite number of apps and places, but they keep exploring over time. In particular, two distinct profiles of individuals emerge: those that keep changing places and services, and those that are stable over time, named as \"explorers\" and \"keepers\". We see these findings as crucial to enrich a discussion for the potentials and the challenges of building human-centric AI systems, which might leverage recent results in Computational Social Science.",
          "The analysis of human activity data is an important research area in the context of ubiquitous and social environments. Using sensor data obtained by mobile devices, e. g., utilizing accelerometer sensors contained in mobile phones, behavioral patterns and models can then be obtained. However, the utilized models are often not simple to interpret by humans in order to facilitate assessment, evaluation and validation, e. g., in computational social science or in medical contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating interpretable rule sets for classification: We present an adaptive framework for mining class association rules using subgroup discovery, and analyze different techniques for obtaining the final classifier. The approach is investigated in the context of human activity recognition. For our evaluation, we apply real-world activity data collected using mobile phone sensors.",

          "Combining passive smartphone sensor data with self-reports enables the study of everyday life behavior. The DiversityOne dataset, recently released to the UbiComp community, overcomes the limitation of existing datasets by containing data from eight countries from both Global South and Global North, including data from 782 college students, combining the data from 26 smartphone sensors and 350K+ self-reports, and extensive demographic and psychosocial survey data from 18K college students. The richness of the dataset opens the way to investigating important problems in multiple disciplines. Existing studies that leverage the dataset have only scratched the surface of the potential research questions it can help answer.

          "Abstract Digital habits remain poorly quantified despite ever-present concerns regarding problematic social media use. Through a mixed-methods study of 6,816 participants and 12,899 app-specific responses across six major platforms, we compare self-reported habit measures (via the Self-Reported Habit Index) with longitudinal behavioural tracking data collected over a 6 week period. Our analysis reveals three key insights: First, app usage shows strong habitual patterns (Facebook: mean SRHI = 4.88), exceeding established benchmarks for health-related habits like smoking. Second, we find weak correlations (r=0.28-0.32) between SRHI scores and actual usage metrics, exposing significant discrepancies in self-assessment accuracy. Third, machine learning demonstrates that simple behavioural history (sessions/hours) predicts future usage at least 64% more effectively than SRHI measures. These results challenge the predictive validity of self-report instruments in digital habit research and suggest observational data offers superior predictive power. Our findings have immediate implications for intervention design, platform accountability, and the methodological evolution of habit research in computational social science.",

          "Introduction As citizens of the information age, we are leaving pervasive digital traces of our idiosyncratic behavior– in emails, on online social networking sites, in mobile phone call logs, in ATM machines, in metropolitan train systems. Researchers in the emerging field of Computational Social Science (CSS) are attempting to create quantitative models of large-scale human social systems from these digital traces, as well as address key questions like privacy, data-ownership and sharing of interaction data. Recent work has focused on online techniques, e.g. mining corporate emails and crawling social networking sites to build maps of social interactions. In contrast, mass-market mobile phones allow sensing and analysis of the building blocks of social interactions – those that occur face-to-face. Eagle & Pentland (2005) and later Dong & Pentland (2006) used Bluetooth proximity information to recognize social patterns in daily activity infer relationships, identify socially relevant locations and model organizational rhythms.",

          "Abstract Cognition has been found to constrain several aspects of human behaviour, such as the number of friends and the number of favourite places a person keeps stable over time. This limitation has been empirically defined in the physical and social spaces. But do people exhibit similar constraints in the digital space? We address this question through the analysis of pseudonymised mobility and mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000 individuals in a European country for six months. Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we find that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of applications they regularly use. Moreover, we find that this capacity steadily decreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more complex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications get added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of individuals: app keepers and explorers , which differ in their stable (keepers) vs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile applications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and explorers may considerably vary across the two domains. Our empirical findings provide an intriguing picture linking human behaviour in the physical and digital worlds which bridges research studies from Computer Science, Social Physics and Computational Social Sciences.",
          "Recently, with the widespread use of smart devices, a huge amount of data is being accumulated in various domains. In case of public transportation, smart cards have been introduced for the purpose of convenient payment systems. The smart card transaction data can be utilized not only for the exact and convenient payment but also for civil planning and computational social science based on travel tracking of citizens. This paper focuses on the analysis of the transportation convenience using the smart card big data. In this end, a new index is developed to reflect how passengers actually experience the transportation systems in their travels. A grid-based geo-coding technique, GeoHash, is particularly used to divide the regions in a city. Passengers’ movement information such as moving distance and time and the amount of movements between regions are utilized to access the convenience of each region. A smart card data for a week in March is used to evaluate the convenience of each region in Seoul metropolitan city. The contribution of this study is that a new transportation convenience index was developed based on the reality data that passengers actually experience, and that this index can provide the quantative measure in civil planning such as a traffic policy or local policy.",
          "The availability of new data sources following the digital revolution has greatly enhanced our ability to study human behaviour in real-world contexts. This development has given rise to Computational Social Science, a new discipline that aims to uncover patterns in human behaviour through an inherently multidisciplinary approach. From analyzing collective behaviour with complex networks, to developing computational models for social science questions, researchers have come together to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how we act as individuals and as communities. In this context, we investigate human behaviour using multiple data sources with varying level of contextual and environmental information. On one side, we study it through the lens of Living Labs, experiments that use sensors and mobile devices to collect behavioural data from users in real or realistic environments. Here, we focus first on the social dimension of human behaviour by modelling face-to-face interactions and examining how individuals organize into communities. Specifically, we propose a modelling approach to enrich these datasets, which often lack temporal depth or have a limited number of participants due to the high costs of data collection. We then analyze students’ daily schedules using a dataset richer in context, which includes activity and location information along with details about with whom they interacted, thanks to self-reported Time Diaries. We show how this richer context is important for describing their behavioural shifts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other side, we examine human behaviour through the lens of mobility data. With the wide availability of GPS data, the study of how people commute and live in cities has been transformed, from analysing mobility patterns and distances travelled, to transportation usage, to detecting colocations that indicate social gatherings. Visits to Points of Interest (POIs)} can also be used to construct sequences of daily activities, such as going to a bar or seeing a movie, similarly to the aforementioned time use diaries. In this way,we can address several challenges inherent to data collection in living labs, such as limited participant numbers, constrained spatial environments, and short observation windows. In this work, we combine data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which provides time use diaries for thousands of individuals, with GPS data provided by a location intelligence company. By applying insights into human routines, we investigate the biases that may arise when using mobility data to infer daily activities, and we highlight the need for caution when employing such data in contemporary research.",
          "New technologies have made it possible to collect information about social networks as they are acted and observed in the wild , instead of as they are reported in retrospective surveys. These technologies offer opportunities to address many new research questions: How can meaningful information about social interaction be extracted from automatically recorded raw data on human behavior? What can we learn about social networks from such fine-grained behavioral data? And how can all of this be done while protecting privacy? With the goal of addressing these questions, this article presents new methods for inferring colocation and conversation networks from privacy-sensitive audio. These methods are applied in a study of face-to-face interactions among 24 students in a graduate school cohort during an academic year. The resulting analysis shows that networks derived from colocation and conversation inferences are quite different. This distinction can inform future research in computational social science, especially work that only measures colocation or employs colocation data as a proxy for conversation networks.",
          "The rapid expansion of the on-demand economy has profoundly reshaped urban mobility and logistics, yet high-resolution trajectory data on delivery riders' consistent movements remains scarce. Here, we present a city-scale, high-resolution spatiotemporal trajectory dataset of on-demand instant delivery riders in Beijing. This dataset was produced through a path-reconstruction methodology applied to an open dataset containing delivery order information. Subsequently, detailed and continuous trajectories were reconstructed by simulating cycling routes via a major online map service to ensure they were realistically aligned. For validation, the reconstructed paths were compared against ground-truth travel metrics, revealing a strong correlation with actual travel patterns. The analysis yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 for route distance and 0.79 for route duration. This high fidelity ensures the dataset's utility for describing delivery riders' mobility. This publicly available resource offers unprecedented opportunities for researchers in urban planning, transportation studies, logistics optimization, and computational social science to investigate rider behavior, model urban freight systems, and develop more efficient and sustainable city-wide logistics solutions.",

          "Cognition has been found to constrain several aspects of human behaviour, such as the number of friends and the number of favourite places a person keeps stable over time. This limitation has been empirically defined in the physical and social spaces. But do people exhibit similar constraints in the digital space? We address this question through the analysis of pseudonymised mobility and mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000 individuals in a European country for six months. Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we find that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of applications they regularly use. Moreover, we find that this capacity steadily decreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more complex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications get added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of individuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers) vs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile applications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and explorers may considerably vary across the two domains. Our empirical findings provide an intriguing picture linking human behaviour in the physical and digital worlds which bridges research studies from Computer Science, Social Physics and Computational Social Sciences.",
          "Behavioral measurement is the hallmark of research in the field of computational social science. We are witnessing innovative as well as clever use of existing and novel, commercial, or research-grade “sensors” to measure various aspects of human behavior and well-being. Passive sensing, a version of measurement where data is gathered and tracked unobtrusively using pervasive and ubiquitous sensors, is increasingly recognized and utilized in organizational science research. This chapter presents an overview of where passive sensing has been successful in workplace measurement, ranging from assessing worker personality and productivity, to their well-being, and understanding the overall organizational pulse. A range of passive sensing infrastructures are described (e.g., smartphones, wearable devices, social media) and several machine-learning-based predictive approaches are noted in this body of research. The chapter then highlights outstanding challenges as this field matures, which include issues of limited generalizability in computational measurement of workplace behaviors, gaps and limitations of gold standard assessment, model simplicity and sophistication tradeoffs, and, importantly, privacy risks. The chapter concludes with recommendations on important areas that need further or altogether new investments, so as to fully realize the potential of passive sensing technologies in more accurate, actionable, and ethical workplace measurement.",
          "Wearable sensing platforms like modern smart phones have proven to be effective means in the complexity and computational social sciences. This paper draws from explicit (phone calls, SMS messaging) and implicit (proximity sensing based on Bluetooth radio signals) interaction patterns collected via smart phones and reality mining techniques to explain the dynamics of personal interactions and relationships. We consider three real human to human interaction networks, namely physical proximity, phone communication and instant messaging. We analyze a real undergraduate community's social circles and consider various topologies, such as the interaction patterns of users with the entire community, and the interaction patterns of users within their own community. We fit distributions of various interactions, for example, showing that the distribution of users that have been in physical proximity but have never communicated by phone fits a gaussian. Finally, we consider five types of relationships, for example friendships, to see whether significant differences exist in their interaction patterns. We find statistically significant differences in the physical proximity patterns of people who are mutual friends and people who are non-mutual (or asymmetric) friends, though this difference does not exist between mutual friends and never friends, nor does it exist in their phone communication patterns. Our findings impact a wide range of data-driven applications in socio-technical systems by providing an overview of community interaction patterns which can be used for applications such as epidemiology, or in understanding the diffusion of opinions and relationships.",
          "Smartphones and IoT devices are opening unprecedented opportunities to conduct social science studies in large-scale and longitudinal fashions. They enable unobtrusive collection of rich behavioral dataset such as physical sensory readings and on-line application use patterns. Also, smartphones can be used as 24/7 gateways for real-time intervention and feedback. Such powerful capabilities can facilitate larger-scale and timely social studies in a cost-effective way beyond traditional study methods such as self-reports, interviews, surveys, and observations under laboratory settings, etc. Many exploratory works have proven that mobile phones are a promising computational platform upon which we plan, develop, and conduct various experimental studies related to social science disciplines.",
          "The ubiquity of mobile phones worldwide is generating an unprecedented amount of human behavioral data both at an individual and aggregated levels. The study of this data as a rich source of information about human behavior emerged almost a decade ago. Since then, it has grown into a fertile area of research named computational social sciences with a wide variety of applications in different fields such as social networks, urban and transport planning, economic development, emergency relief, and, recently, public health. In this paper, we briefly describe the state of the art on using mobile phone data for public health, and present the opportunities and challenges that this kind of data presents for public health.",

          "Activities of people, recorded via digital devices or online environments, offer increasingly comprehensive pictures of both individual and group-level behavior, potentially allowing inferences within and outside the platforms. These digital traces are often in the form of textual units such as tweets or Reddit posts or comments. Compared to solicited survey responses, social media posts are the organic, unsolicited thoughts of people on a variety of topics, and the language in these posts are a key to their attitudes, beliefs and values. Notwithstanding the many promises of digital traces, recent studies have begun to discuss the errors that can occur when digital traces are used to learn about social phenomena. In this thesis, I propose to first, diagnose and characterize issues in the measurement of people's attitudes at scale, and second, mitigate these errors through theory-driven solutions. To critically study and record errors and biases in using digital traces for measuring human behavior, we propose a systematic framework, named 'Total Error Framework for Digital Traces' (TED). TED is inspired by and adapted from the Total Survey Error Framework, developed and employed in survey methodology to assess the validity and reliability of survey-based studies. To mitigate errors unearthed by examining Computational Social Science through TED, we apply several domain specific solutions, such as using linguistic theories to understand people's attitudes. This thesis contributes in improving the reliability and validity of attitude measurement from digital traces.",
          "As a computer scientist working on algorithms and applications for human behaviour analysis since the 90s, I was able to witness the rise of \"big data,\" which was jokingly defined by one of my university professors as \"data that would not fit on your computer\". Indeed, such is the volume of data constantly generated by humans moving about with mobile phones in their pockets, using devices and services that create, store and share information about such usage, contributing and propagating content on social media, that it becomes difficult to organise, classify and interpret these digital traces with traditional computational approaches. Add to this the devices and systems that observe humans, such as surveillance cameras, smart infrastructure elements that log users, remote sensing and satellite systems, and the picture becomes even more complex. Yet, with ample opportunities for monetisation, approaches and systems were quickly developed to process big data. In particular, companies quickly recognised that big data collected from customers could provide valuable insights for marketing and optimisation tasks, for content customisation, user adaptation and modelling. But such data were also valuable to governments for decision-making and policy, and for many researchers interested in human behaviour, including those in the field of migration research, looking for reliable and granular indicators of human movements over the globe. The main premise of computational social science (or social computing) is that large-scale and complex human behavioural data, typically stored by companies that benefit from it for the mentioned purposes, can be analysed and re-purposed to address research questions from the social sciences (Lazer et al., 2020). In this new paradigm, carefully constructed samples and in-depth questions were replaced by numbers of subjects greater by orders of magnitude, and simple indicators that were sampled across much greater temporal and spatial resolutions than the traditional \"snapshots\". In addition, these were analysed in an aggregated fashion to provide proxy variables. For example, in a seminal study related to migration research, Blumenstock et al. (2015) illustrated that a person's mobile phone usage history could be used to create a wealth indicator. They used mobile phone call detail records (CDR) collected for accounting purposes by the phone company and containing the base tower locations, times, and durations of phone calls for each customer. Aggregating anonymised data from 1.5 million customers, Blumenstock and co-authors created a detailed map that predicted the wealth of people living in Rwanda, which showed a high correlation with the last two Demographic and Health Surveys conducted with seven and thirteen thousand people, respectively, at a fraction of the cost, and in a very timely fashion. Does this mean that similar big data initiatives can be easily created all over the world to enable improved analyses of factors known to relate to migration (Sîrbu et al., 2021), or to provide timely insights to policy makers? Hardly so; there are technical, ethical, legal, and as Scheel and Ustek-Spilda (2018) highlighted, political hurdles that hinder adopting big data solutions in migration statistics. Before continuing further, I would like to point out that the big data usage examples I advocate work with anonymised and aggregated data, and do not—in principle—involve data, which can be used to identify specific individuals. In the last few years, several instances of technology usage in areas related to migration management came into question (Molnar, 2021). Particularly, high-tech solutions for large-scale biometric identification of refugees, drone and robotic surveillance in the borders, automatic decision-making based on artificial intelligence solutions in sensitive areas where the cost of an error cannot (and should not) be quantified, including lie detection technologies at European borders have been discussed in terms of their ethical and human rights ramifications. Molnar (2021, p.134) also pointed out that Covid-19 increased the investment in technological solutions and states that \"as governments move towards biosurveillance to contain the spread of the pandemic, there has been an increase in the use of tracking, automatic drones and other types of technologies that purport to help manage migration, exacerbating potential human rights concerns (Cliffe, 2020; Lewis & Mok, 2020; Molnar & Naranjo, 2020).\" These are all valid concerns, but it is possible to process big data with proper checks and balances, controlling for both individual and group privacy (Salah, Canca, et al., 2022), and we should weigh their usefulness in the context of specific risks. After all, flexible and ubiquitous technologies such as mobile phones do have many uses - such as in helping to contain the spread of a pandemic (Oliver et al., 2020), and the existence of technology—and associated data—brings an obligation with it, in that if it is possible to responsibly harness it for improving the lives of people, it should be considered seriously by governmental and non-governmental actors (Letouzé & Oliver, 2019). The primary potential of big data for migration research seems to be in addressing data gaps (Bircan et al., 2020; Bosco et al., 2022), which are created by, for instance, inconsistencies in the definitions and data collection methodology, lack of adequate statistics and plainly lacking data on irregular migration. Different data types may provide information about such gaps (Salah, Bircan, et al., 2022). Mobile phone call detail records contain very detailed mobility information, but some exceptions aside, are processed without linking it to demographic information, to protect the privacy of the data subjects. Nonetheless, it can be used to produce wealth indicators, show the concentration and mobilities of groups, indicate infrastructure usage, and even provide indicators of social integration by modelling intergroup encounters and communication (Bakker et al., 2019). Remote sensing provides population estimates that are considered valuable information in contexts of natural and man-made disaster areas and climate-related mobility (Bircan, 2022). Social media data can be a particularly rich source offering different insights depending on the platform. For example, Twitter can provide information about sentiments of and about migrants and refugees while LinkedIn can offer indicators about skilled migration, and Facebook on demographics (Bosco et al., 2022; Coimbra et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022). Combining multiple data sources can potentially be even more powerful; for example, refugee mobility and settlement can be observed via mobile phone data, and real-estate price averages can be linked to home locations, so examining these two sets of data together provides an opportunity to estimate refugee wealth in greater detail (Bertoli et al., 2019). What are the premises under which data gaps are filled? First of all, data access is an important issue. Some of these data sources are publicly available for research (e.g. remote sensing data with limited resolution), but others are buried in the servers of private companies and very difficult to access (e.g. mobile CDR). Second, processing such high volumes of data requires mastery of data scientific tools, possibly including database management systems, scripting tools and analysis tools that range from natural language processing to image processing, depending on the modality. Ideally, this calls for interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists and migration scholars. The third premise is the translation of migration scholars' inquiries (or the data gap) into the disciplinary language of computer scientists while simultaneously avoiding reductionisms typical for this field. For instance, if social integration is to be assessed via mobile phone data, quantitative indicators should be found that are of relevance to social integration, and they need to be validated with some approach. Blumenstock et al. (2015) used previous census data to validate their method, but if there is a data gap to be addressed, there may not be such an obvious choice. The assumptions under which the approximations and projections would work should also be determined in collaboration to account for not only domain expertise, but also biases that may come from the algorithmic models employed. Finally, applied ethics expertise is required to properly assess the potential risks, and this topic is mostly lacking from most technical computer science curricula. The ethical review is necessary not only for the study itself but also for the communication of results, given the sensitivity that surrounds how the findings are communicated. As a way of addressing the first difficulty, Verhulst and Young (2019) proposed data collaboratives, which are public-private partnerships based on data owned by private parties. Different models have been proposed for such collaborations (Letouzé & Oliver, 2019), but the main idea is that a private dataset is re-purposed for public good. Data challenges are a form of data collaboratives, where the private data are processed to remove personal information and opened to a larger research community, allowing multiple groups to analyse it from different aspects (Salah, 2021). An example of such challenges was the Data for Refugees (D4R) project supported by TUBITAK, UNHCR, UNICEF and IOM, where Türk Telekom opened a mobile CDR dataset collected in Turkey from 1 million users over a year to provide insights into Syrian refugee mobility in Turkey with the aim of improving their living conditions (Salah et al., 2019). This challenge, with 60+ participating research teams (and an ethics committee examining both the projects and resulting publications) was useful for capacity building, initialising inter-disciplinary and international collaborations, and creating some policy recommendations. However, a challenge is (typically) a one-off event and sustainable data processing requires longer relationships, where the infrastructure must be created to share computed indicators instead of the data itself. Furthermore, to be truly useful, data-driven recommendations must be taken up by researchers with deep domain expertise and by policy makers, further investigated, combined and triangulated with existing information sources and evaluated by taking into account other qualitative factors influencing research and policy considerations. Bridging the data gaps requires actions from all involved parties, including private data holders, policy makers, and most importantly, migration scholars and data scientists bridging disciplinary language gaps.

          "A warm welcome to the First ACM Workshop on Mobile Systems for Computational Social Science (MCSS'12) co-located with MobiSys'12. We are very excited to introduce you to the technical program of our workshop, which includes 7 papers, representing high-quality research conducted over a broad spectrum of topics related to mobile systems and computational social science. Each paper was reviewed by three members of our Technical Program Committee._x000D_\n_x000D_\nFor decades, behavioral scientists have struggled to understand the various factors that influence behavior. Observational and self-report methods have shed some light on those factors, but the nature of such methods can elicit responses that are not always completely accurate. Furthermore, such methods usually capture behavior as it occurs in a laboratory as opposed to behavior as it naturally occurs in everyday life. Recent advances in mobile technology provide some extremely powerful tools for overcoming these obstacles. Indeed, mobile phones represent an ideal platform for studying behavior and interactions in real-life contexts. There are many open challenges in terms of system design: for instance, since mobile phones are battery powered, efficient algorithms have to be developed to derive accurate inferences from sensor data, and cloud resources can be exploited to support complex computations. Given their diffusion, mobile phones allow to develop systems at scale, i.e., supporting mobile applications potentially used by millions of people at the same time. Data collected by means of mobile phones can then be used for analysis of human behavior and interactions. There are also many challenges in this area, especially related to the management of personal data and real-time processing of information. Mobile systems will represent a key foundational component of the emerging discipline of computational social science. We really hope that this workshop will be an opportunity to build a community around these themes._x000D_\n_x000D_\nThe workshop program has been structured into three technical sessions, namely, Social Sciences and Mobile Systems, Algorithms and Techniques for Computational Social Science and Applications and Deployments. Moreover, we organized two invited keynote sessions and a poster and demonstration session.",
          "The increasing availability of mobile phone data has attracted the attention of several researchers interested in studying our collective behaviour. Our interactions with the phone network can take several forms, from SMS messages to phone calls and data usage. Typically, mobile phone data are released to researchers in the form of call detail records , which contain records of different types of interactions, and can be used to analyse various aspects of our behaviour. However, the inherently behavioural nature of these interactions may result in differences between how we make phone calls and receive text messages. Studies which rely on data derived from these interactions, therefore, need to carefully consider these differences. Here, we aim to investigate differences and limitations of different types of mobile phone interactions data by analysing a large mobile phone dataset. We study the relationship between different types of interactions and show how it changes over time. We anticipate our findings to be of interest to all researchers working in the area of computational social science.",
          "Big data, specifically Telecom Metadata, opens new opportunities for human behavior understanding, applying machine learning and big data processing computational methods combined with interdisciplinary knowledge of human behavior. In this thesis new methods are developed for human behavior predictive modeling based on anonymized telecom metadata on individual level and on large scale group level, which were studied during research projects held in 2012-2016 in collaboration with Telecom Italia, Telefonica Research, MIT Media Lab and University of Trento. It is shown that human dynamics patterns could be reliably recognized based on human behavior metrics derived from the mobile phone and cellular network activity (call log, sms log, bluetooth interactions, internet consumption).&#13;\\nOn individual level the results are validated on use cases of detecting daily stress and estimating subjective happiness. An original approach is introduced for feature extraction, selection, recognition model training and validation. Experimental results based on ensemble stochastic classification and regression tree models are discussed. On large group level, following big data for social good challenges, the problem of crime hotspot prediction is formulated and solved. In the proposed approach we use demographic information along with human mobility characteristics as derived from anonymized and aggregated mobile network data. The models, built on and evaluated against real crime data from London, obtain accuracy of almost 70% when classifying whether a specific area in the city will be a crime hotspot or not in the following month. Electric energy consumption patterns are correlated with human behavior patterns in highly nonlinear way. Second large scale group behavior prediction result is formulated as predicting next week energy consumption based on human dynamics analysis derived out of the anonymized and aggregated telecom data, processed from GSM network call detail records (CDRs). The proposed solution could act on energy producers/distributors as an essential aid to smart meters data for making better decisions in reducing total primary energy consumption by limiting energy production when the demand is not predicted, reducing energy distribution costs by efficient buy-side planning in time and providing insights for peak load planning in geographic space. All the studied experimental results combine the introduced methodology, which is efficient to implement for most of multimedia and real-time applications due to highly reduced low-dimensional feature space and reduced machine learning pipelines. Also the indicators which have strong predictive power are discussed opening new horizons for computational social science studies.",
          "The ubiquity of sensor-rich and computationally powerful smartphones makes them an ideal platform for conducting social and behavioural research. However, building sensor data collection tools remains arduous and challenging: it requires an understanding of the varying sensor programming interfaces as well as the research issues related to building sensor-sampling systems. To alleviate this problem and facilitate the development of social sensing and data collection applications, we are developing a set of open-source smartphone libraries to collect, store and transfer, and query sensor data. Furthermore, we have also developed a library that can trigger notifications based on time or sensor events to assist experience sampling methods. This paper presents these libraries' architecture, initial feedback from developers using it, and a sensing application that we built using them to study daily affect."

          "Vaccine hesitancy has been a common concern, probably since vaccines were created and, with the popularisation of social media, people started to express their concerns about vaccines online alongside those posting pro- and anti-vaccine content. Predictably, since the first mentions of a COVID-19 vaccine, social media users posted about their fears and concerns or about their support and belief into the effectiveness of these rapidly developing vaccines. Identifying and understanding the reasons behind public hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines is important for policy markers that need to develop actions to better inform the population with the aim of increasing vaccine take-up. In the case of COVID-19, where the fast development of the vaccines was mirrored closely by growth in anti-vaxx disinformation, automatic means of detecting citizen attitudes towards vaccination became necessary. This is an important computational social sciences task that requires data analysis in order to gain in-depth understanding of the phenomena at hand. Annotated data is also necessary for training data-driven models for more nuanced analysis of attitudes towards vaccination. To this end, we created a new collection of over 3,101 tweets annotated with users' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination (stance). Besides, we also develop a domain-specific language model (VaxxBERT) that achieves the best predictive performance (73.0 accuracy and 69.3 F1-score) as compared to a robust set of baselines. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first dataset and model that model vaccine hesitancy as a category distinct from pro- and anti-vaccine stance.",
          "Recent studies have devoted attention to the effects of both expression and reception in communication process. However, there remain both theoretical and methodological complexities concerning <i>whether</i> and <i>under what condition</i> message expression and reception play significant but different roles in explaining various psychosocial health outcomes. Relying on theoretical insights from the social support literature and methodological innovations offered by computational social science, this study aims to examine the effects of empathic exchanges on cancer patient's short- and long-term psychosocial health outcomes. Our findings suggest that both empathy expression and reception are crucial to attaining benefits for cancer patients, each predicting differential cognitive and affective health outcomes. Further, our finding supports the stress-buffering hypothesis such that empathy reception provides a beneficial effect for patients who experienced a higher degree of depression associated with their cancer diagnosis and follow-up treatments.",
          "Recently, the whole of Europe, including Poland, have been significantly affected by COVID-19 and its social and economic consequences which are already causing dozens of billions of euros monthly losses in Poland alone. Social behaviour has a fundamental impact on the dynamics of spread of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, challenging the existing health infrastructure and social organization. Modelling and understanding mechanisms of social behaviour (e.g. panic and social distancing) and its contextualization with regard to Poland can contribute to better response to the outbreak on a national and local level.In the presented study we aim to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 on society by: (i) measuring the relevant activity in internet news and social media; (ii) analysing attitudes and demographic patterns in Poland. In the end, we are going to implement computational social science and digital epidemiology research approach to provide urgently needed information on social dynamics during the outbreak.This study is an ad hoc reaction only and our goal is to signal the main areas of possible research to be done in future and cover issues with direct or indirect relation to public health.",
          "Novel data science approaches are needed to confront large-scale infectious disease epidemics such as COVID-19, human immunodeficiency viruses, African swine flu and Ebola. Human beings are now equipped with richer data and more advanced data analytics methodologies, many of which have become available only in the last decade. The theme issue Data Science Approaches to Infectious Diseases Surveillance reports the latest interdisciplinary research on developing novel data science methodologies to capitalize on the rich ‘big data’ of human behaviours to confront infectious diseases, with a particular focus on combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to conventional public health research, articles in this issue present innovative data science approaches that were not possible without the growing human behaviour data and the recent advances in information and communications technology. This issue has 12 research papers and one review paper from a strong lineup of contributors from multiple disciplines, including data science, computer science, computational social sciences, applied maths, statistics, physics and public health. This introductory article provides a brief overview of the issue and discusses the future of this emerging field. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Data science approaches to infectious disease surveillance’.",
          "ABSTRACT Using a computational social science approach integrating evolutionary psychology, social psychology, and intergroup relations, this research examined associations between disease threats and group identification across cultures by analyzing the relationship between COVID‐19 threats (actual and perceived) and first‐person plural versus singular pronoun usage—a linguistic marker of collective identity. Two studies analyzed epidemiological and Google Trends search data over 154 weeks: Study 1 established baseline patterns using U.S. data, while Study 2 investigated cross‐cultural variations globally. Through transfer function methodology to pre‐whiten time series data for cross‐correlation function analysis and random‐slope‐random‐intercept multilevel modeling, the research explored temporal dynamics of threat‐identification relationships. Results indicated that perceived COVID‐19 threat, measured through pandemic‐related search volumes, exhibited consistent correlations with increased first‐person plural pronoun usage across both studies. While COVID‐19 cases demonstrated non‐significant relationships globally but positive associations in the U.S., mortality rates showed negative correlations with first‐person plural pronoun usage globally, differing from U.S. patterns. Cultural collectivism emerged as a moderating factor in the global analysis, with individualistic cultures displaying stronger associations between perceived threat and collective linguistic markers. These findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between collective threats and group identification processes across cultures while demonstrating the potential of computational linguistic analysis for monitoring real‐time collective responses to pandemics, offering insights relevant to preparedness strategies for future global challenges.",
          "Aiming at the serious harm of depression, a depression intervention model from the perspective of computational social science is proposed. The proposed model is based on the social media data of users. The LSTM model was used to analyze the potential depressive tendencies of users, while the psychiatric PHQ-9 depression scale was employed as a tool to diagnose depression and measure depression severity. The LDA model was utilized to identify the topics that users are concerned about, and these topics were considered important sources of their depressive moods. Subsequently, corresponding book prescriptions were provided for the implementation of bibliotherapy to carry out sociological intervention. A quantitative evaluation system for a depression intervention model from the perspective of computational social science was established to an extent in the present study, which promotes the standardization of depression interventions. This system would significantly reduce the consumption of health resources, with real social and economic benefits.",
          "Psychological wellbeing has long been studied through surveys and interviews that rely on individuals’ self-reported experiences. With the rise of digital communication, however, new opportunities have emerged to observe how wellbeing is expressed organically in everyday language. This study investigates how the multidimensional components of a wellbeing framework -- the PERMA+H framework, are reflected in Finnish online discussions, using a large-scale dataset from the Suomi24 forum spanning from 2001 to 2020. By applying a lexicon-based approach to extract wellbeing-related features and employing Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for clustering and visualisation, the study identifies distinct patterns of wellbeing expression across different subforums and over time. The analysis reveals thematic zones of wellbeing: Positive Emotion and Relationships often co-occur in emotionally expressive spaces, while Engagement and Accomplishment are prevalent in discussions of work and study. A “low wellbeing” region was also identified, alongside a gradual decline in wellbeing indicators across the two-decade period. These findings suggest that online discourse can meaningfully reflect psychological states and their temporal shifts. By bridging positive psychology, computational social science, and the emerging field of wellbeing informatics, this research offers new insights into how emotional life manifests and evolves within digital communities.",

We present a three-dimensional framework for integrating these forms and a unified computational methodology for evaluating them concurrently. The dimensions represent increases or decreases in semantic 1) sentiment, 2) breadth, and 3) intensity. These dimensions can be complemented by the evaluation of shifts in the frequency of the target words and the thematic content of its collocates. This framework enables lexical semantic change to be mapped economically and systematically and has applications in computational social science. We present an illustrative analysis of semantic shifts in mental health and mental illness in two corpora, demonstrating patterns of semantic change that illuminate contemporary concerns about pathologization, stigma, and concept creep.",

          "Background Online communities provide support for individuals looking for help with suicidal ideation and crisis. As community data are increasingly used to devise machine learning models to infer who might be at risk, there have been limited efforts to identify both risk and protective factors in web-based posts. These annotations can enrich and augment computational assessment approaches to identify appropriate intervention points, which are useful to public health professionals and suicide prevention researchers. Objective This qualitative study aims to develop a valid and reliable annotation scheme for evaluating risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation in posts in suicide crisis forums. Methods We designed a valid, reliable, and clinically grounded process for identifying risk and protective markers in social media data. This scheme draws on prior work on construct validity and the social sciences of measurement. We then applied the scheme to annotate 200 posts from r/SuicideWatch—a Reddit community focused on suicide crisis. Results We documented our results on producing an annotation scheme that is consistent with leading public health information coding schemes for suicide and advances attention to protective factors. Our study showed high internal validity, and we have presented results that indicate that our approach is consistent with findings from prior work. Conclusions Our work formalizes a framework that incorporates construct validity into the development of annotation schemes for suicide risk on social media. This study furthers the understanding of risk and protective factors expressed in social media data. This may help public health programming to prevent suicide and computational social science research and investigations that rely on the quality of labels for downstream machine learning tasks.",
          "ABSTRACTThe article aims at exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lay discourses of depression emerging in online mental health forums. The narrative framing of depression plays a central role not only because it affects the instrumental strategies of depressed people (e.g., preferred therapy), but also because it is a constitutive element of the identity of depressed people, thus affects the process of recovery itself. COVID-19 had a serious impact on people living with mental disorders (especially depression and anxiety), thus our research aimed at mapping the consequences of these transformations on a discursive level. A textual dataset of English language online health forums was collected (n = 339,550 publicly available entries posted between 15 February 2016 and 31 December 2020). Structural topic modelling was used to explore the various discursive patterns characterizing the pre-pandemic and pandemic era. Our results show that the pandemic did not take over the discursive space of depression forums, yet it transformed many aspects of it: a new horizon of critique opened up; the biomedical authority was reinforced; the ego-centric perspectives were refined; the previously unquestionable discursive frames become fragmented; and the horizon of emergency overshadowed the previous risk perspective.KEYWORDS: COVID-19e-mental healthdepressiononline forumstructural topic modelnatural language processing AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank Fanni Máté for her contribution to data collection.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Data availabilityThe data are not publicly available due to confidentiality reasons but the preprocessed data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Notes1 FREX score is a weighted average between word frequency in a given topic and the degree to which the word appears only in the given topic (i.e. exclusivity) (Bischof & Airoldi, Citation2012).

          "Purpose This study aims to reveal how the COVID-19 vaccine was accepted in the Japanese Twitter-sphere. This study explores how the topics related to the vaccine promotion project changed on Twitter and how the topics that were likely to spread changed during the vaccine promotion project. Design/methodology/approach The computational social science methodology was adopted. This study collected all tweets containing the word “vaccine” using the Twitter API from March to October 2021 and conducted the following analysis: analyzing frequent words and identifying topics likely to spread through the cosine similarity and Tobit model. Findings First, vaccine hesitancy–related words were frequently mentioned during the vaccine introduction and dissemination periods and had diffusing power only during the former period. Second, vaccine administration–related words were frequently mentioned and diffused through April to May and had diffusing power throughout the period. The background to these findings is that the sentiment of longing for vaccines outweighed that of hesitancy toward vaccines during this period. Originality/value This study finds that the timing of the rise in vaccine hesitation sentiment and the timing of the start of vaccine supply were misaligned. This is one of the reasons that Japan, which originally exhibited strong vaccine hesitancy, did not face vaccine hesitancy in the COVID-19 vaccine promotion project.",

          "Vaccine hesitancy has been a common concern, probably since vaccines were created and, with the popularisation of social media, people started to express their concerns about vaccines online alongside those posting pro- and anti-vaccine content. Predictably, since the first mentions of a COVID-19 vaccine, social media users posted about their fears and concerns or about their support and belief into the effectiveness of these rapidly developing vaccines. Identifying and understanding the reasons behind public hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines is important for policy markers that need to develop actions to better inform the population with the aim of increasing vaccine take-up. In the case of COVID-19, where the fast development of the vaccines was mirrored closely by growth in anti-vaxx disinformation, automatic means of detecting citizen attitudes towards vaccination became necessary. This is an important computational social sciences task that requires data analysis in order to gain in-depth understanding of the phenomena at hand. Annotated data is also necessary for training data-driven models for more nuanced analysis of attitudes towards vaccination. To this end, we created a new collection of over 3,101 tweets annotated with users' attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination (stance). Besides, we also develop a domain-specific language model (VaxxBERT) that achieves the best predictive performance (73.0 accuracy and 69.3 F1-score) as compared to a robust set of baselines. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first dataset and model that model vaccine hesitancy as a category distinct from pro- and anti-vaccine stance.",

          "The adverse impacts of child sexual abuse (CSA) are well documented in the literature but there is a paucity of research regarding a specific sub-type of CSA referred to as mother-daughter sexual abuse. Mother-daughter sexual abuse (MDSA) is a highly stigmatized and misunderstood form of child sexual abuse. This study examines the nature of MDSA by identifying and analyzing patterns of abuse and the associated psychological impact experienced by survivors. Information was gathered from publicly available social media posts on Reddit. A Google script and Pushshift were used to extract 82 posts and transfer the data into Dedoose for thematic analysis using select computational social science methods. Open and axial coding established a coding framework to develop and understand themes, contextualize the data, and examine the relationships between themes. Survivors describe feeling shame, disgust, and confusion about MDSA. Sexually abusive behaviors by the offending mothers included non-consensual touching, non-consensual vaginal penetration, body shaming, exposure to pornography at a young age, and grooming daughters for abuse by men. Survivors indicated tenuous relationships with their mothers lasting into adulthood, possible mental health disorders of their mothers, and the significant emotional abuse and inappropriate enmeshment. Survivor's disclosed suffering a range of mental health challenges that contribute to difficulties with interpersonal relationships. Survivors were hesitant to disclose to friends, family, and helping professionals because they fear being misunderstood or judged because of their experiences with MDSA. This study fills a large gap in the literature on MDSA and future studies need to examine how to better support survivors with interventions and resources more specifically. Increased understanding of survivor's experiences with MDSA will help inform, educate, and raise awareness to ensure survivors are able to cope or overcome their traumatic experiences.",
          "As social media platforms are increasingly adopted, the data the data people leave behind is shining new light into our understanding of phenomena, ranging from socio-economic-political events to the spread of infectious diseases. This chapter presents research conducted in the past decade that has harnessed social media data in the service of mental health and well-being. The discussion is organized along three thrusts: a first that highlights how social media data has been utilized to detect and predict risk to varied mental health concerns; a second thrust that focuses on translation paradigms that can enable to use of such social media based algorithms in the real-world; and the final thrust that brings to the fore the ethical considerations and challenges that engender the conduct of this research as well as its translation. The chapter concludes by noting open questions and problems in this emergent area, emphasizing the need for deeper interdisciplinary collaborations and participatory research design, incorporating and centering on human agency, and attention to societal inequities and harms that may result from or be exacerbated in this line of computational social science research.",

          "Large-scale observational datasets are prevalent in many areas of research, including biomedical informatics, computational social science, and finance. However, our ability to use these data for decision-making lags behind our ability to collect and mine them. One reason for this is the lack of methods for inferring the causal impact of rare events. In cases such as the monitoring of continuous data streams from intensive care patients, social media, or finance, though, rare events may in fact be the most important ones-signaling critical changes in a patient's status or trading volume. While prior data mining approaches can identify or predict rare events, they cannot determine their impact, and probabilistic causal inference methods fail to handle inference with infrequent events. Instead, we develop a new approach to finding the causal impact of rare events that leverages the large amount of data available to infer a model of a system's functioning and evaluates how rare events explain deviations from usual behavior. Using simulated data, we evaluate the approach and compare it against others, demonstrating that it can accurately infer the effects of rare events.",
          "Hate crimes and hateful rhetoric targeting individuals of Asian descent have increased since the outbreak of COVID-19. These troubling trends have heightened concerns about the role of the Internet in facilitating radicalization. This article explores the existence of three warning signs of radicalization-fixation, group identification, and energy bursts-using data from Twitter and Reddit. Data were collected before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 to assess the role of the pandemic in affecting social media behavior. Using computational social science and Natural Language Processing techniques, we looked for signs of radicalization targeting China or Chinese individuals. Results show that fixation on the terms China and Chinese increased on Twitter and Reddit after the pandemic began. Moreover, tweets and posts containing either of these terms became more hateful, offensive, and negative after the outbreak. We also found evidence of individuals identifying more closely with a particular group, or adopting an \"us vs. them\" mentality, after the outbreak of COVID-19. These findings were especially prominent in subreddits catering to self-identified Republicans and Conservatives. Finally, we detected bursts of activity on Twitter and Reddit following the start of the pandemic. These warning signs suggest COVID-19 may have had a radicalizing effect on some social media users. This work is important because it not only shows the potential radicalizing effect of the pandemic, but also demonstrates the ability to detect warning signs of radicalization on social media. This is critical, as detecting warning signs of radicalization can potentially help curb hate-fueled violence.",
          "Prevailing methods for assessing population-level mental health require costly collection of large samples of data through instruments such as surveys, and are thus slow to reflect current, rapidly changing social conditions. This constrains how easily population-level mental health data can be integrated into health and policy decision-making. Here, we demonstrate that natural language processing applied to publicly-available social media data can provide real-time estimates of psychological distress in the population (specifically, English-speaking Twitter users in the US). We examine population-level changes in linguistic correlates of mental health symptoms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the killing of George Floyd. As a case study, we focus on social media data from healthcare providers, compared to a control sample. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of how the tools of computational social science can be applied to provide real-time or near-real-time insight into the impact of public events on mental health.",

          "Abstract Computational social science has had a profound impact on the study of health and disease, mainly by providing new data sources for all of the primary Ws—what, who, when, and where—in order to understand the final “why” of disease. Anonymized digital trace data bring a new level of detail to contact networks, search engine and social media logs allow for the now-casting of symptoms and behaviours, and media sharing informs the formation of attitudes pivotal in health decision-making. Advances in computational methods in network analysis, agent-based modelling, as well as natural language processing, data mining, and time series analysis allow both the extraction of fine-grained insights and the construction of abstractions over the new data sources. Meanwhile, numerous challenges around bias, privacy, and ethics are being negotiated between data providers, academia, the public, and policymakers in order to ensure the legitimacy of the resulting insights and their responsible incorporation into the public health decision-making. This chapter outlines the latest research on the application of computational social science to epidemiology and the data sources and computational methods involved and spotlights ongoing efforts to address the challenges in its integration into policymaking.",
          "The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on many aspects of life. The global economic downturn is one of these negative consequences. Nonetheless, even though everyone feels the threat of this pandemic for themselves, some people still have the empathy to help others. An empirical analysis of this empathy attitude is expected to be a catalyst in realizing a social force for the community to work together to combat this pandemic. This study will look at how people felt about donating during the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. The goals of this study are to (1) compare differences in donor desire before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using the developed model, and (2) determine whether there is a significant difference in empathy for donating before and during the pandemic. This study employs computational social science (CSS) techniques to achieve this goal. The data was obtained from Twitter using the keyword \"donation\" in the 24 months preceding the pandemic and in the 24 months following the pandemic's arrival in Indonesia. Data analysis includes hypothesis testing using Mann-Whitney and Cohen's D statistical tests, showing a significant increase in online donation support among Indonesian Twitter users since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. From the results of data processing data obtained 159.995 data in accordance with the criteria to be analyzed. From the results of the Mann-Whitney test, all variables showed significant results between before and during the Covid-19 pandemic and in the results of the Cohen's d test, all variables got a large effect size. From the results of the two tests, it can open Twitter social media users who have increased empathy to donate during the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia",

          "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to bring up various topics discussed or debated on social media. In order to explore the impact of pandemics on people's lives, it is crucial to understand the public's concerns and attitudes towards pandemic-related entities (e.g., drugs, vaccines) on social media. However, models trained on existing named entity recognition (NER) or targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) datasets have limited ability to understand COVID-19-related social media texts because these datasets are not designed or annotated from a medical perspective. This paper releases METS-CoV, a dataset containing medical entities and targeted sentiments from COVID-19-related tweets. METS-CoV contains 10,000 tweets with 7 types of entities, including 4 medical entity types (Disease, Drug, Symptom, and Vaccine) and 3 general entity types (Person, Location, and Organization). To further investigate tweet users' attitudes toward specific entities, 4 types of entities (Person, Organization, Drug, and Vaccine) are selected and annotated with user sentiments, resulting in a targeted sentiment dataset with 9,101 entities (in 5,278 tweets). To the best of our knowledge, METS-CoV is the first dataset to collect medical entities and corresponding sentiments of COVID-19-related tweets. We benchmark the performance of classical machine learning models and state-of-the-art deep learning models on NER and TSA tasks with extensive experiments. Results show that the dataset has vast room for improvement for both NER and TSA tasks. METS-CoV is an important resource for developing better medical social media tools and facilitating computational social science research, especially in epidemiology. Our data, annotation guidelines, benchmark models, and source code are publicly available (https://github.com/YLab-Open/METS-CoV) to ensure reproducibility.",

          "Recently, the whole of Europe, including Poland, have been significantly affected by COVID-19 and its social and economic consequences which are already causing dozens of billions of euros monthly losses in Poland alone. Social behaviour has a fundamental impact on the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, challenging the existing health infrastructure and social organization. Modelling and understanding mechanisms of social behaviour (e.g. panic and social distancing) and its contextualization with regard to Poland can contribute to better response to the outbreak on a national and local level. In the presented study we aim to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 on society by: (i) measuring the relevant activity in internet news and social media; (ii) analysing attitudes and demographic patterns in Poland. In the end, we are going to implement computational social science and digital epidemiology research approach to provide urgently needed information on social dynamics during the outbreak. This study is an ad hoc reaction only, and our goal is to signal the main areas of possible research to be done in the future and cover issues with direct or indirect relation to public health.",
          "Studies on depression in the workplace have mostly investigated its impact on individual employees. Little is known about its association with the company as a whole, or the state where the company is based. This is due to the lack of scalable methodologies operationalizing depression in the specific context of the workplace, and of data documenting potential distress. In this work, we adapted a work-related depression scale called Occupational Depression Inventory (ODI), gathered more than 350K employee reviews of 104 major companies across the whole US for the (2008-2020) years, and developed a deep-learning framework (called AutoODI) scoring these reviews on a composite ODI score. Presence of ODI mentions manifested itself not only at micro-level (companies scoring high in ODI suffered from low stock growth) but also at macro-level (states hosting these companies were associated with high depression rates, talent shortage, and economic deprivation). This new way of applying AutoODI onto company reviews offers both theoretical implications for the literature in computational social science, occupational health and economic geography, and practical implications for companies and policy makers."

          "One of the unfortunate findings from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is the disproportionate impact the crisis has had on people and communities who were already socioeconomically disadvantaged. It has, however, been difficult to study this issue at scale and in greater detail using social media platforms like Twitter. Several COVID-19 Twitter datasets have been released, but they have very broad scope, both topically and geographically. In this paper, we present a more controlled and compact dataset that can be used to answer a range of potential research questions (especially pertaining to computational social science) without requiring extensive preprocessing or tweet-hydration from the earlier datasets. The proposed dataset comprises tens of thousands of geotagged (and in many cases, reverse-geocoded) tweets originally collected over a 255-day period in 2020 over 10 metropolitan areas in North America. Since there are socioeconomic disparities within these cities (sometimes to an extreme extent, as witnessed in ‘inner city neighborhoods’ in some of these cities), the dataset can be used to assess such socioeconomic disparities from a social media lens, in addition to comparing and contrasting behavior across cities.",

          "The increasing prevalence of location sharing features on social media has enabled researchers to ground computational social science research using geolocated data, affording opportunities to study human mobility, the impact of real-world events, and more. This paper analyzes what crucially separates tweets with geotags from tweets without. Our findings show that geotagged tweets are not representative of Twitter data at large, limiting the generalizability of research that uses only geolocated data. We collected 1.3M geotagged tweets on Twitter (most of which came from Instagram), and compared them with a random dataset of tweets on three aspects: affect, content, and audience engagement. We show that geotagged tweets on Twitter exhibit significantly more positivity, often citing joyous and special events such as weddings, graduations, and vacations. They also convey more collectivism by using more first-person plural pronouns and contain more additional features such as hashtags or objects in images. However, geotagged tweets generate less engagement. These findings suggest there exist significant differences in the messages conveyed in geotagged posts. Our research carries important implications for future research utilizing geolocation social media data.",
          "Social media are playing an increasingly important role as information resource in tourism both for customers&#13;\\n(i.e the tourists), who gather trustworthy information from peers supporting the choice of destinations and&#13;\\nservices, and for businesses, which may use the same information for improving their product supply. According to Benitez et Al. (2007) tourists are an important target audience for spatial planning. Likewise, sustainable&#13;\\ntourism should be strongly rooted and integrated in spatial planning and development process of destinations.&#13;\\nHowever, information related to tourists’ perceptions and opinion often is not properly analysed by planners.&#13;\\nThe success of a tourist destination depends mainly of factors related to both the location and the services that&#13;\\nthe local industry may offer (Crouch et Al., 2004).

It is a prime example for demonstrating how to turn digital data into a high-quality social science data set. It is also exemplary for combining digital data with historically grown job ads data to provide a comparable time series covering the past 70 years. Paying close attention to sampling procedures, coverage, and key variables, the Data Brief shows how the SJMM profits from opportunities offered by computational social science and computational linguistics to navigate a wholly new set of challenges involved in creating such a data set. It closes with a discussion of new research opportunities this data set is opening for investigating the labour market as a core institution of modern society.",
          "The dataset comprises 58,261 tweets collected through the Twitter Academic API, representing one of the few systematic archives of social media discourse around major disasters in South Asia. What makes this dataset particularly valuable is its multi-layered structure. Beyond the raw tweets, we have developed a processed user-level dataset with derived metrics such as spread_score and focus_rate that researchers can use to analyze information diffusion patterns. Additionally, we include 1,500 manually annotated tweets with labels for user types and content categories, which we used to train a few-shot classification model achieving a recall score of 0.72. This annotated subset can serve as a benchmark for future machine learning applications in disaster communication research. The dataset addresses a significant gap in available resources for studying disaster response in the Global South context. Researchers in fields ranging from computational social science to public policy and disaster management will find this resource useful for examining stakeholder communication dynamics, temporal patterns in information flow, and the role of different actors—governments, NGOs, media, and citizens—during crisis events.",
          "Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location. Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore, it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably, bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections. Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis, and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.",
          "Twitter is a major social media platform in which users send and read messages (\"tweets\") of up to 140 characters. In recent years this communication medium has been used by those affected by crises to organize demonstrations or find relief. Because traffic on this media platform is extremely heavy, with hundreds of millions of tweets sent every day, it is difficult to differentiate between times of turmoil and times of typical discussion. In this work we present a new approach to addressing this problem. We first assess several possible \"thermostats\" of activity on social media for their effectiveness in finding important time periods. We compare methods commonly found in the literature with a method from economics. By combining methods from computational social science with methods from economics, we introduce an approach that can effectively locate crisis events in the mountains of data generated on Twitter. We demonstrate the strength of this method by using it to locate the social events relating to the Occupy Wall Street movement protests at the end of 2011.",

However, there is a gap in our understanding regarding the communication of limited information to the public during times of crisis. This study focuses on the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic as a crisis scenario and investigates how state governors utilized Twitter to communicate with the public, as well as the subsequent impact on citizens' responses. Employing computational social science techniques, this research analyzes a dataset comprising 47,831 tweets posted by U.S. state governors during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning from March to August 2020.

          "Established religious institutions are increasingly shifting their activities away from meeting people's needs for internal growth and purpose and toward more external forms or pursuits unrelated to spiritual life. Thus, the media not only transmits information, but it also actively produces and frames religious issues, thereby defining what is sacred. Semantic network analysis was used in the study to investigate khutbahs (sermons) and Twitter data from the Turkish Official Religious Institution. Findings reveal that digital religious activities have a stronger relationship with secular topics in tweets than with khutbahs. It is also an attempt to explain how digital media favors secular views over religious views, putting pressure on religious institutions to conform. The result of digital mediatization in the sacred context is a new social and cultural condition in which the power to define and practice religion has been altered. The findings also make a methodological contribution by addressing long-standing questions in digital mediatization of the sacred using \"computational social science\" methods. These tools are used to analyze khutbahs and tweets to study the mediatization of the sacred in a non-Western context, and the results have implications for the secularization debate.",

In this case study, we find that the number of photos taken and subsequently uploaded to Flickr with titles, descriptions or tags related to Hurricane Sandy bears a striking correlation to the atmospheric pressure in the US state New Jersey during this period. Appropriate leverage of such information could be useful to policy makers and others charged with emergency crisis management.",
          "Although with some reluctance, social sciences now seem to have accepted the challenge deriving from the growing digitisation of communication and the consequent flow of data on the web. There are actually various empirical studies that use the digital traces left by the myriads of interactions that occur through social media and e-commerce platforms, and this trend also concerns the research in the PCST field. However, the opportunity offered by the digitisation of traditional mass media communication — the newspapers in particular — is much less exploited. Building on the experience of the TIPS project, this paper discusses the advantages and the limits of computational social science on PCST using newspapers as the main source of data. Some methodological issues are also addressed, in order to suggest a more aware use of such data and the several computational tools available for analysing them.",
          "The historiographic method has been developed over time as a mediological research apparatus. Oral&#13;\\nsources, written sources, material sources, and iconographic sources are media, and therefore&#13;\\nphysical recording, storage and circulation devices to which correspond specific circulation modes,&#13;\\ngeneral symbolization processes and social communication codes. The productions traceable within&#13;\\nthe universes of social media and social network sites belong to the sources available today. Since the&#13;\\nmain system of media objects production has changed, the researcher's work has to go through the&#13;\\nanalysis and the understanding of its basic mechanisms. The historical problem of source verification&#13;\\ndoes not cease to be at the center of the research of the historian, but on the contrary it poses further&#13;\\nchallenges. These problems are similar to those of social researchers, because it is necessary to take&#13;\\ninto consideration a transformation of the reality of communication where offline and online&#13;\\nenvironments are increasingly closely correlated, and where the possible forms of communication&#13;\\ngenerate new possibilities for analysis.

          "This thesis examines Twitter's role in social and political mobilisation in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), since the broader regional uprisings of 2010 -11 (the Arab Spring). It seeks to answer the question of what role Twitter plays in the politics of the GCC region on distinct levels, including that of society (grassroots), state (government and monarchy) and between states (diplomatic relations). The discussion is undertaken in light of Jurgen Habermas's 1960s theory of the public sphere and its ongoing conceptual developments in the information era. This thesis uses the methodological frameworks provided by communication studies, political science and computational social science. Drawing on the Twitter archive, complemented by pertinent secondary sources, it applies a novel hashtag-driven method to collect and collate data on historical cases. In doing so it identifies and conceptually develops the 'hashtag public sphere' (HTPS), a term coined to describe the contribution of Twitter's hashtag function to the formation of the online public sphere. A number of case studies are utilised in order to show Twitter's diverse role in shaping GCC politics across distinct spheres. This thesis calls on recent examples of Twitter activism, showing how Twitter is implicated in new forms and directions of online activism, intersecting with offline protest. It covers both known and anonymous accounts, from the six GCC states, and examines the regional phenomenon of @mujtahidd. It illustrates how Twitter is opening up new spaces for dissent in the traditionally restrictive political and media environments of the authoritarian Gulf states. At the same time, this thesis points to the way in which Twitter is increasingly being hijacked by governments - through the creation of bots and electronic committee accounts or via the manipulation of hashtag trending topics - in an attempt to shape public opinion, direct debate and curtail the nascent freedoms of their citizens. Twitter continues to foment unrest, as GCC region citizens take to social media with demands for greater freedom and political reform, while governments jockey to manipulate and seize control of the emerging online public sphere. This thesis additionally looks at Twitter's role in political dialogue and diplomatic relations between GCC states, showing how Twitter is used to deliver political messages, set political agendas and interfere in the internal affairs of other GCC states. As Twitter contributes to an escalation of tensions, the familial and diplomatic ties that have long prevailed are under imminent threat. Indeed, the circulation of a language of war on Twitter, places at risk the continuing unity of the GCC and threatens the future security and stability of the region's states and citizens.",
          "Social media are playing an increasingly important role as information resource in tourism both for customers (i.e. the tourists), who gather trustworthy information supporting the choice of destinations and services from peers, and for businesses, which can use the same information for improving their marketing strategies. The use of social media data can also offer new opportunities for decision-support in tourism planning. With improved understanding of the motivations of tourists and tailoring tourism service supply, decision making can be facilitated by emphasizing the strengths of tourist destinations for past and potential visitors. However, this kind of information about tourists perceptions and opinions is not always properly analysed by planners. Understanding the user satisfaction, which depends on factors related to both the location and the services that the local industry proposes, may offer valuable information in tourism planning at regional and local level. In the light of the above premises, the goal of the study presented in this paper is to propose an integrated approach to investigate the relationships between tourists satisfaction, destination resources and tourism industry for supporting design and decision-making in regional tourism planning. The methodology developed in the study includes data collection from popular tourism social media platforms (i.e. Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com.com), and their integration with territorial and tourism data. Spatial and statistical analysis techniques are then applied to elicit insights from tourists perceptions on success factors which may be used in decision-making and planning support. The case study demonstrates the value of social media data and computational social science techniques in tourism planning. The paper concludes with a critical discussion on the potential of using such an approach in more general urban and regional planning setting.",
          "This is the last report of the project “Virtual ethnography with Latin Kings”, aimed to analyze the presence of this street group on the social media. Our first report provided a background study about how youth street groups are studied online by the scientific community. Our second deliverable consisted of raw data gathered from social media. This last deliverable updates the data previously collected and carries out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data. The main objectives are as follows: first, to detect the social media presence of Latin King members; second, to better understand how Latin Kings use the social media under study; third, to determine how Latin Kings members interact within these social media; and fourth, to ascertain what are the main elements that describe the cultural construction of the Latin Kings through their representations, self-representations and practices on social media. Thus, the study presented here provides an overview of the presence and content generation of the Latin Kings street group in the virtual sphere. In contrast to previous ethnographies with this community, the current approach comes from the knowledge of traditional ethnography that had been done previously by other authors and the principal investigator of the TRANSGANG ERC project in order to add a new layer corresponding to the online realm. A virtual ethnography has been undertaken mixing quantitative and qualitative methods that include social network analysis, computational social science, content analysis and informetrics. This report provides a better understanding of the Latin King community by analyzing social media content in which they actively decided to be involved, in contrast to traditional media content portrayals. Our first approach to the study of youth street groups online offers a system and method of analysis that allows us to find identity traces and communicative trends among the Latin King community in Youtube. Although the procedure can be refined and extended to other contexts (countries and social media platforms), we believe that it points in the right direction to a non-criminalized approach to the study of youth street groups online and that we have faced some of the challenges previously detected. The findings obtained should be of interest to gang scholars and contribute to furthering knowledge in the research area.",

          "One of the unfortunate findings from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis is the disproportionate impact the crisis has had on people and communities who were already socioeconomically disadvantaged. It has, however, been difficult to study this issue at scale and in greater detail using social media platforms like Twitter. Several COVID-19 Twitter datasets have been released, but they have very broad scope, both topically and geographically. In this paper, we present a more controlled and compact dataset that can be used to answer a range of potential research questions (especially pertaining to computational social science) without requiring extensive preprocessing or tweet-hydration from the earlier datasets. The proposed dataset comprises tens of thousands of geotagged (and in many cases, reverse-geocoded) tweets originally collected over a 255-day period in 2020 over 10 metropolitan areas in North America. Since there are socioeconomic disparities within these cities (sometimes to an extreme extent, as witnessed in ‘inner city neighborhoods’ in some of these cities), the dataset can be used to assess such socioeconomic disparities from a social media lens, in addition to comparing and contrasting behavior across cities.",
          "The dataset comprises 58,261 tweets collected through the Twitter Academic API, representing one of the few systematic archives of social media discourse around major disasters in South Asia. What makes this dataset particularly valuable is its multi-layered structure. Beyond the raw tweets, we have developed a processed user-level dataset with derived metrics such as spread_score and focus_rate that researchers can use to analyze information diffusion patterns. Additionally, we include 1,500 manually annotated tweets with labels for user types and content categories, which we used to train a few-shot classification model achieving a recall score of 0.72. This annotated subset can serve as a benchmark for future machine learning applications in disaster communication research. The dataset addresses a significant gap in available resources for studying disaster response in the Global South context. Researchers in fields ranging from computational social science to public policy and disaster management will find this resource useful for examining stakeholder communication dynamics, temporal patterns in information flow, and the role of different actors—governments, NGOs, media, and citizens—during crisis events.",
          "The news media industry has continued to evolve through a sustained period of disruption and adaptation. In recent years, one of the central challenges for larger news media companies has been the integration of computation skills and technical knowledge into the routines and day-to-day work of media. This study approaches the study of shifting skills in organizations through an in-depth analysis of the job titles and skills that comprise modern newsrooms. Computational social science methodology is applied to an analysis of a large-scale dataset tracking job advertisements across industries from 2010 to present day. K-means clustering and other computational approaches were used to identify trends in job skills, as well as the corresponding job titles. The findings from this analysis show the clear and steady influx of computational, data science and programming skills into journalism job descriptions. In many cases, traditional jobs such as editors and reporters, have started to incorporate technical skills as a core representation of the identity of those jobs. In other cases, entirely new job roles, such as news analysts or big data researchers, have become a more integral part of the newsroom workforce.",
          "ABSTRACT There are many valuable insights on jobs and professions in different sectors of society based on their imminent and ascribed characteristics. Studying such characteristics traditionally was done by action research, surveys, questionnaires, etc. which typically take much time and resources to be concluded. In this study we examine vocational education and training data on Twitter. While we present a generic framework to retrieve, process and analyze tweets, we will discuss two research questions from computational social science: First, how can we make Twitter data interoperable to other available resources, e.g. classifications of occupations, tools and skills? Second, do we have enough data to process job collocational prestige analysis on a geographical basis? This presents a novel approach towards labor market research, making novel data interoperable which has not been considered in previous literature. Our approach and pipeline is generic and could be easily extended to other languages. It also contributes to prestige research by widening the question of ascribed prestige to the question how information on occupations is collocated and what these contextualisations tell us about how occupations are seen.",
          "Abstract Hajj is the spiritual and religious journey of a lifetime for many Muslims around the world. In June 2022, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah decided to introduce a new travel booking system that mandated pilgrims from Europe, America, Australia, and New Zealand to reserve directly their pilgrimage travels, thus bypassing the local Hajj travel operators. Additionally, Motawif was deployed just a few weeks before the 2022 Hajj. This announcement triggered a wave of panic among would‐be pilgrims and resulted in an intense social media conversation. This article examines the conversation that took place on Twitter (now X) for the period following the launch of Motawif and up until the completion of the 2022 Hajj. Using computational social science methods, we undertook several analyses of the Twitterspace to understand the perceptions of the would‐be pilgrims with the Motawif system. The study illuminates how forms of community organizing in online spaces (and associated information practices and discursive strategies) have contributed to reconstituting the Hajj pilgrim's identity and agency in ways rarely seen before among this community. Our findings also point to various strategies and information practices of opposition that enable connective action through solidarity and recognition of shared grievances."

          "Recent years have witnessed a tremendous growth in globally generated data as well as in the fast evolution of technologies that allows, in real time, to capture, analyse, and exploit huge data repositories. As data sizes grows, so does the general agreement that data is highly valuable. The automatic extraction of information, together with pioneering data mining and predictive analytics techniques, represents an effective and competitive opportunity, particularly to support decision making processes to answer various research and evaluation questions. In this context Big Data (BD) and the Computational Social Science (CSS) approaches, are expected to challenge the ways social scientist, analysts, and evaluators have worked so far. Big Data are today generally utilized by private business while they remain deeply underutilized in public policy-making sector. Its potential has probably not yet been fully understood. Although significant economic incentives made private businesses move first, there is no reason to hold proper usage of Big Data in the public sector. In evaluation research, BD is even more under-utilized, even when the evaluated interventions could be closely monitored in real-time, this is rarely done. At the present time, there is no much scientific and professional debate on how to integrate Big Data within the evaluation research field. Hence, the main aim of this special issue is to improve knowledge on applicability of BD techniques in the evaluation research for supporting decision-making processes.",
          "In the era of digital information, data can be accessed, recorded, trajected, and analysed conveniencely. Big Data is not solely a trend amongst the exculsive group, instead, it marks the paradigm swift particularly to undersand the social processes. Data, which generated on social media, is an avalanche of Big Data era. For the academics, Big Data challenges the social researchers by the changing of unit of analysis from human to algortihms. This article discusses the opportunities and pitfalls of Big Data in social science research. This is a literature review that derived mainly from journals published in prominent scientific publications such as Taylor & Francis, Elsevier, and Sage. The main purpose is to yield a basic knowledge and fill the gap for non-computer scientists, regarding the implementation of Big Data in the research. The result that Big Data has opportunities to deliver the multidiscipline field of study (computer, social and statistic); overcome the limitation of convesional methods of data gathering (both quantitative and qualitative); and offers an analytical framework for sociology field of study. Big Data imposes challenges such as common understanding of Big Data , methodology and theory issues, and research ethic debates.  Key words : Big Data, Social, Research, Opportunities, Challenges  Memasuki era digital, segala data (informasi) mudah diakses, disimpan, ditelusuri, bahkan dianalisa. Big Data bukan sekadar tren yang dipopulerkan oleh kalangan eksklusif, melainkan sebuah penanda perubahan paradigma untuk memahami proses-proses sosial. Data yang dihasilkan di media sosial merupakan sebagian kecil dari  “longsoran bola salju” di era Big Data.  Bagi kalangan akademisi, Big Data telah memberikan tantangan bagi peneliti sosial dengan adanya perubahan unit analisis dari manusia menjadi algoritma. Artikel ini membahas peluang dan tantangan Big Data bagi peneliti sosial dari sisi literatur yang berasal dari publikasi luar negeri seperti Taylor & Francis, Elsevier, Sage publication . Tujuannya adalah untuk memberikan pemahaman mendasar sekaligus mengisi kesenjangan pengetahuan terkait implementasi Big Data dalam penelitian bagi ilmuwan non ilmu komputer. Hasil kajian ini menemukan bahwa ada tiga peluang Big Data : munculnya terobosan multidisiplin ilmu “ computational social science ”; menjawab keterbasan metode pengumpulan data konvensional baik kuantitatif maupun kualitatif; serta menawarkan kerangka analisis bagi ilmuwan sosiologi.

          "Many others, in this volume and elsewhere, have and will comment on the political, social, economic, cultural and ethical implications of Big Data. (1)I strongly agree that those implications are important.Indeed, I believe they are the most urgent aspects of Big Data with which critically engaged social science must grapple.There is a good fight to be fought in the public arena over the many worrying directions in which the political-economic impulses driving Big Data are pointing.The complicated ways in which the Big Data movement (if we can call it that) is entangled with a burgeoning, authoritarian and surveillant state, simultaneously enabling and in thrall to a rhetoric of free-market 'disruption', demand our close attention, if they are to be countered by more humane alternatives.There is, of course, a substantial literature that refuses to roll over before the technological triumphalism (or is it fatalism?) of work such as Too Big To Know (Weinberger, 2011) and Big Data (Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier, 2013).Many of the concerns raised by the current moment are ably dissected in Digital Disconnect (McChesney, 2013), The Filter Bubble (Pariser, 2011), You Are Not A Gadget (Lanier, 2010) Who Owns The Future? (Lanier, 2014), and To Save Everything, Click Here (Morozov, 2013) among others.Given the centrality of geographical data of one kind or another to the data deluge, it is surely important that geographers become more visible in this public conversation (Farmer and",
          "Abstract Computational social science has integrated social science theories and methodology with big data analysis. It has opened a number of new topics for big data analysis and enabled qualitative and quantitative sociological research to provide the ground truth for testing the results of data mining. At the same time, threads of evidence obtained by data mining can inform the development of theory and thereby guide the construction of predictive models to infer and explain more phenomena. Using the example of the Internet data of China’s venture capital industry, this paper shows the triadic dialogue among data mining, sociological theory, and predictive models and forms a methodology of big data analysis guided by sociological theories.",
          "Digital sociology is a computational social science that uses modern information systems and technologies, has already formed. But the conflict with traditional sociology and its research methods has not yet been resolved. This conflict can be overcome if we remember that there is a common goal – the knowledge of the phenomena and processes of social life, which is primary in relation to the methods to be agreed upon. Digital transformation of sociology is essential, since 1) traditional sociological methods do not solve the problem of providing voluminous, reliable empirical data qualitatively and in a short time; 2) the transition from contact research methods to unobtrusive ones is in demand. The adaptation of four modern information technologies-cloud computing, big data, the Internet of things and artificial intelligence – for the purposes of sociology provides a qualitative transition in the methodology of knowledge of the digital society. Cloud computing provide researchers with tools, big data – research materials, Internet of things technology aimed at collecting indicators (receiving signals) in large volume, in real time, as direct, not indirect evidence of human behavior. The development of “artificial intelligence” technology expands the possibility of receiving processed signals of the quality of the social system without building a preliminary hypothesis, in a short time and on a large volume of processed data. Digital transformation of sociology does not mean abandoning the use of traditional methods of sociological analysis, but it involves expanding the competence of a sociologist, which requires a revision of University curricula. At the same time, combining the functions of an expert on the subject (sociologist) and data analyst in one specialist is assessed as unpromising, it is proposed to combine their professional competencies in working on unified research projects.",
          "In this paper, we discuss at The 8th International Workshop on Application of Big Data for Computational Social Science, October 26-29, 2023, Venice, Italy. To achieve the realization of the Global and Innovation Gateway for All (GIGA) initiative (2019), proposed in December 2019 by the Primary and Secondary Education Planning Division of the Elementary and Secondary Education Bureau of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, a movement has emerged to utilize information and communication technology (ICT) in the field of education. The history of ICT education in Japan dates back to the 100 Schools Project (1994), which aimed to provide network access environments, and the New 100 Schools Project (1997), which marked the beginning of full-scale ICT education in Japan. In this paper, we discuss the usage dynamics of smartphone-based learning applications among young people (analyzing data from January to September 2020) and their current status. Further, the results are summarized and future research topics and issues are discussed. The results show that there are situations in which ICT learning environments can be effectively utilized and others in which they cannot, depending on the differences between digital students and analog students who utilize ICT in their studies; this indicates that we are currently in a transition to a generation of digital natives. ICT education has both advantages and disadvantages, and it is expected that it will be used in combination with conventional educational methods while assessing the characteristics of ICT education in the future. Of course, there are many challenges. We plan to discuss how to appeal in this regard at the Workshop.",

          "Despite abundant data and increasing data availability brought by technological advances, there has been very limited education policy studies that have capitalized on big data—characterized by large volume, wide variety, and high velocity. Drawing on the recent progress of using big data in public policy and computational social science research, this commentary discusses how to approach big data and how big data can be used in education policy research. First, I introduce big data that is potentially relevant to education policy research. I then present methodological frontiers by examining the assumptions, key concepts, merits, and caveats of three commonly used analytical approaches to mining massive amounts of text data: topic models, network text analysis, and sentiment analysis. Next, to ensure the veracity of using big data in education policy research, I debunk three methodological misconceptions. This commentary concludes with a discussion on developing interdisciplinary research capacity and addressing the privacy concerns and ethical conundrums as we explore a research agenda of using big data in education policy.",

          "According to popular belief, Big Data and Machine Learning provide a brand-new approach to science that has the potential to revolutionize scientific progress (Hey et al., 2009; Kitchin, 2014). The extreme version of this belief is illustrated by Anderson’s claim that Big Data and Machine Learning in science will lead to the “end of theory” (Anderson, 2008). The idea behind this extreme version of the belief is that advanced Big Data and Machine Learning algorithms<br/>enable us to mine vast amounts of data related to a given problem without prior knowledge and we do not need to worry about causality, as correlation is all that is needed.<br/>The extreme version of this belief is not seriously held by many philosophers of science, but<br/>there are several serious attempts to determine the extent to which Big Data and Machine Learning imply a resurgence of inductive methods (Pietsch, 2021) or agnostic science (Napoletani et al., 2021). Without claiming that “the theory came to its end”, these approaches advocate new scientific methods that can be applied to various fields in a similar way, without the need for domain-specific knowledge.<br/>Two questions arise in connection with these views: Where did these ideas come from? and to what extent are they justified? The first question could be addressed by following the hype around Big Data and Machine Learning in industry and how easily conversations about new innovations and disruptions translate into conversations about paradigm shifts in science. The leakage of the style of argumentation and the attraction to hype, from industry to science,<br/>should be carefully watched and frequently questioned. In these times of pressure to bridge the gap between business and science, it can be difficult to distinguish valuable insights and ideas from superficial buzz-talk. The case of Big Data and Machine Learning is one of the areas, which shows how important it is to clearly map the flow of knowledge between business and science. We do not, however, make any scientific progress towards this question, we only sketch our observations here.<br/>Regarding our second question, we argue that using methods from Big Data and Machine Learning is not a passive mode where you feed raw data into a Big Data or Machine Learning algorithm and wait for the algorithm to detect correlations between features of a massive dataset. We argue that there is always work in manipulating data, cleaning data, etc. that requires significant domain knowledge of scientific applications.<br/>We agree that expert domain knowledge used in Big Data and Machine Learning is of a different kind from that required by traditional methods. The question we ask is about the required amount of expert knowledge needed for Big Data and Machine Learning methods to function in an efficient manner. By carefully assessing examples of Big Data and Machine Learning 46 Abstracts<br/>applications in science, such as skin cancer detection (Esteva et al., 2017), protein folding (Senior et al., 2020) and language generation (Brown et al., 2020), we assess which knowledge plays a role in each of these cases. We observe that significant domain knowledge is needed, not so much in theory and model building, but in data preparation and validation of Machine<br/>Learning models. Data needs to be labelled appropriately, decisions need to be made about which data to include, and new features might need to be created. Furthermore, we need to know what constitutes a well-functioning Machine Learning algorithm for a given problem, what we should measure and what is a good enough value to constitute a solution to the problem.<br/>In addition to expert knowledge about data samples, specific knowledge of Machine Learning is also often needed, as algorithms cannot be applied blindly in practice. A promising model architecture needs to be selected, appropriate data augmentation techniques need to be applied to increase the performance of the algorithm, and the algorithm needs to be tuned and adjusted to get good enough Machine Learning performance.<br/>We do not intent to dismiss new scientific methods or new lines of research, but to disclose what work and knowledge the new methods require, and thus show in more detail what is new and what is business as usual. Big Data and Machine Learning methods may be used in a more agnostic way, but they do not lead to completely agnostic science. It is not a question of changing or revolutionizing science, but of expanding the methodological toolkit. This will certainly not necessarily revolutionize all science, but it could lead to changes in subfields and provoke the emergence of new fields or endeavors, such as digital humanities or computational social science.<br/>In our talk, we will discuss concrete case studies (skin cancer detection, protein folding, language generation), where we present methods that are used and we highlight those moments where expert knowledge is involved. We will attempt to classify various aspects of expert knowledge involved in the application of Big Data and Machine Learning methods, for instance, the expert knowledge necessary at the training data sample preparation or the expert<br/>knowledge necessary for choosing algorithms. We will also suggest that, depending on the field, the range of traditional methods vs agnostic methods varies, leading us to believe that the process of “agnosticization” is different from field to field, and that the possibility to reach the “no-theory” stage varies depending on domain. Consequently, we observe that the way in which<br/>Big Data and Machine Learning methods enter scientific methodology involves continuous small conceptual shifts rather than a rigid paradigm shift in Kuhn‘s sense.",
          "Purpose: This chapter critically discusses implications of working with ‘big data’ from the perspective of qualitative research and methodology. A critique is developed of the analytic troubles that come with integrating qualitative methodologies with ‘big data’ analyses and, moreover, the ways in which qualitative traditions themselves offer a challenge, as well as contributions, to computational social science.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nDesign/methodology/approach:&#13;\\nThe chapter draws on Interactionist understandings of social organisation as an ongoing production, tied to and accomplished in the actual practices of actual people. This is a matter of analytic priority but also points to a distinctiveness of sociological work which may be undermined in moving from the study of such actualities, suggesting an alternative coming crisis of empirical sociology.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nFindings: &#13;\\nA cautionary tale is offered regarding the contribution and character of sociological analysis within the ‘digital turn’. It is suggested that ‘big data’ analyses of traces abstracted from actual people and their practices not only miss and distort the relation of social practice to social product but, consequentially, can take on an ideological character.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nOriginality/value: &#13;\\nThe chapter offers an original contribution to current discussions and debates surrounding ‘big data’ by developing enduring critiques of sociological methodology and analysis. It concludes by pointing to contributions and interventions that such an empirical programme of qualitative research might make in the context of the ‘digital turn’ and is of value to those working at the interface of traditional and digital(ised) inquiries and methods.",
          "This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines. In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.",
          "The proliferation of digital data has been presented as heralding a revolution in research methods for the study of social phenomena, such as IS. For some authors, this revolution involves the abandonment of the traditional scientific method in favour of purely inductive data-driven research. Others proclaim the emergence of a new, quantitative, computational social science that will displace qualitative methods, while others see digital data as potentially enriching qualitative research. All these claims, however, take the nature of data for granted, assuming that they straightforwardly instrument reality and that understanding of the world can therefore be gained through their analysis alone. This chapter presents a critical analysis of this ‘pre-factual’ view, arguing that data are not natural givens, but are performed, brought into being by situated practices that enact particular representations of the world. The implications of such a conceptualization of data for research methods in Information Systems and organizational research are discussed.",
          "In recent years, Big Data and Big Data science are frontstage both in prestigious scientific institutions around the world, and in the media. Italy has contributed to the launch of Big Data science in Europe. With more than eight hundred million quotes on Google, Big Data is one of the most cited technoscientific tags. Furthermore, since 2009, when Lazar and colleagues published the famous «Computational Social Science» on Science, Big Data science gave impulse to a new formidable endeavor: the creation of a new quantitative social science through the extensive application of Big Data science to the study of social phenomena. Now, a few years after the launch of the quantitative science of society, it is time for a first evaluation. Did Big Data maintain its promises? Does it still represent an opportunity for a new science of society? The answer provided in this paper is mildly positive. Big Data represents a good opportunity for the innovation of the social sciences on condition that (a) the application of data science to social data is global, rather than local, and oriented to policy, rather than profit-making; (b) the objective of predicting future events does not inhibit the complementary objective of science, i.e. explanatory speculation; and finally (c) quantitative science does not lead to dispense away with the understanding of the cognitive, social, cultural, and political mechanisms that generate social data",
          "Big Data: why (oh why?) this computational social science? David O'Sullivan, Department of Geography, University of California, Berkeley dosullivan@berkeley.edu Many others, in this volume and elsewhere, have and will comment on the political, social, economic, cultural and ethical implications of Big Data. (1) I strongly agree that those implications are important. Indeed, I believe they are the most urgent aspects of Big Data with which critically engaged social science must grapple. There is a good fight to be fought in the public arena over the many worrying directions in which the political-economic impulses driving Big Data are pointing. The complicated ways in which the Big Data movement (if we can call it that) is entangled with a burgeoning, authoritarian and surveillant state, simultaneously enabling and in thrall to a rhetoric of free-market 'disruption', demand our close attention, if they are to be countered by more humane alternatives. There is, of course, a substantial literature that refuses to roll over before the technological triumphalism (or is it fatalism?) of work such as Too Big To Know (Weinberger, 2011) and Big Data (Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier, 2013). Many of the concerns raised by the current moment are ably dissected in Digital Disconnect (McChesney, 2013), The Filter Bubble (Pariser, 2011), You Are Not A Gadget (Lanier, 2010) Who Owns The Future? (Lanier, 2014), and To Save Everything, Click Here (Morozov, 2013) among others. Given the centrality of geographical data of one kind or another to the data deluge, it is surely important that geographers become more visible in this public conversation (Farmer and Pozdnoukhov, 2012). Substantial contributions like Code/Space (Kitchin and Dodge, 2011)",

          "Abstract The proliferation of data associated with the growing digitalization of organizational processes, sometimes designated with the label ‘big data’, offers a potentially rich resource for research. Some management and organization scholars, drawing on claims of the emergence of a data-driven ‘computational social science’, view the new abundance of data, seen as capturing the fundamental elements of organizational processes directly from reality, as contributing to a transformation in our understanding of organizations and the methods by which we study them. The ‘social physics’ envisaged by August Comte in the 1830s, they suggest, can now become a reality. In this chapter, however, a process perspective on data is presented that questions the assumption that data transparently instrument reality. Rather, it is argued, data are always constructed and only ever offer a partial and ambiguous representation of the phenomena they are seen as describing. Archaeology, in which researchers reconstruct phenomena from fragmented evidence, often shaped by their presuppositions, may therefore offer a better model than physics of how the profusion of digital data may contribute to organizational research.",
          "The ‘social’ has always been a commercial and scientific resource – now in the digital age the competition regarding claims to which disciplines have justified understandings of this domain have intensified. The social sciences need to defend their subject area in order to preserve it. An application of the netnographic approach (Kozinets, 2010), social network analysis, data mining and machine-learning tools to highlight the certainties and uncertainties of Big Data and the Health Industry in order to start the process of uncovering the social and cultural forces that they are appropriating. What follows is the application of the tools of Big Data analytics on those that conduct Big Data analytics. There are competing discourses surrounding ‘Big Data’ and Health. On the one hand business, marketing and advertising interests are promoting Big Data as information that no longer requires theory or the scientific methodologies of old. On the other are voices from the academy; digital humanities and computational social sciences that wish to benefit from the volumes of available data. It is these (and other) competing discourses that are the target of this research. This paper argues that those engaged in ‘data without theory’ are generating a relational social mechanism similar to that of self-fulfilling prophesies of Merton, the network effects of Coleman and the bandwagon effects of Granovetter (Donati, 2015:66) and leaving no room for critique.",
          "Starting from the concepts of artificial intelligence and management accounting, this paper analyzes the application of artificial intelligence technology in management accounting, expounds the past and present life of intelligent accounting, and constructs the framework of intelligent accounting system. Human society is unprecedented in two worlds at the same time: the real world and the virtual (digital) world. In the past, accounting was basically a mirror system that reflected objective things with information. It was a monetization mapping of economic activities in the real world, that is, using information system to project the real world. The future intelligent accounting is a cognitive system based on computing power, algorithm and data, which is embedded in the real and virtual world and integrated with this digital virtual world, harmonious symbiosis and resonance with the same frequency. Through the high-level grafting and integration of accounting rules and emerging technologies, that is, the seamless connection between \"borrowing\" and \"lending\" accounting language and computer coding language, it realizes the digital substitution of business activities or transactions in the macro and micro economic and social fields of the real and virtual world. On this basis, based on accounting Big data or full sample data integrated in real time by business, industry or social information, using big data technology and intelligent decision-making tools, provide information services for value feedback and value creation of macro and micro economic subjects. Therefore, intelligent accounting is essentially a basic management activity, which plays the role of big data analysis and auxiliary decision support. It belongs to the interdisciplinary category and has the attribute of computational social science.",
          "WELCOME MESSAGEThis is age of big data, data science and engineering is an essential skill that every computer scientists, software practitioners and other engineers would like to get equipped with.In a broad range of application areas, data is being collected at an unprecedented scale.This can be viewed as both a challenge and an opportunity.Scientific research has been revolutionized by big data.Decisions are made using data-driven mathematical models and big data analysis drives nearly every aspect of the society.Companies such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, LinkedIn and Microsoft have engineered systems catering applications ranging from Web search to content recommendation and computational advertising.There have been persuasive cases made for the value of big data for healthcare, fmance systems, computational social sciences and many more.This conference is intended to take stock of the trends and developments in the globally competitive environment, discuss best practices, and explore strategies and technologies as well as to provide indicators for future directions to researchers and practitioners.The goal of ICDSE 2014 is to provide a forum for researchers, scientists and engineers working in academia and the industries around the world to share their experiences, new ideas, and research results in the emerging areas of data science and engineering.The ICDSE proceedings would accomplish this to a great extent.Fifty four papers were accepted for the conference out of 201 papers received with an acceptance ratio of 0.268.All papers have been reviewed by a team of experts, who are internationally recognized for their work in related areas.This enabled us to establish a certain standard for most of the accepted papers.We thank all authors who took interest in the conference, and considered it a platform to present, and publish their research results.Due to logistical and other constraints, only a few papers could be accepted for inclusion in the proceedings.We thank IEEE for agreeing to publish the proceedings ICDSE 2014 and to include in the IEEExplore®.This will significantly help us in the dissemination of the work of our authors internationally; we thank the IEEE Kerala section for their technical co-sponsorship.",

However, the field is crowded with terminology that makes it difficult to establish reasonable project scopes and to staff and manage projects. This study clarifies the terminology around the data science, computation social science, big data, business intelligence, and analytics and describes their meaning relative to decision support projects. For BI and big data projects, it identifies the critical success factors, empirically classifies the project scopes, and investigates the similarities and differences between the project types. This comparative analysis provides unique insights into the factors and criteria that influence BI and big data project success.

          "The era of ‘big data’ studies and computational social science has recently given rise to a number of realignments within and beyond the social sciences, where otherwise distinct data formats – digital, numerical, ethnographic, visual, etc. – rub off and emerge from one another in new ways. This article chronicles the collaboration between a team of anthropologists and sociologists, who worked together for one week in an experimental attempt to combine ‘big’ transactional and ‘small’ ethnographic data formats. Our collaboration is part of a larger cross-disciplinary project carried out at the Danish Technical University (DTU), where high-resolution transactional data from smartphones allows for recordings of social networks amongst a freshman class (N = 800). With a parallel deployment of ethnographic fieldwork among the DTU students, this research set-up raises a number of questions concerning how to assemble disparate ‘data-worlds’ and to what epistemological and political effects? To address these questions, a specific social event – a lively student party – was singled out from the broader DTU dataset. Our experimental collaboration used recordings of Bluetooth signals between students’ phones to visualize the ebb and flow of social intensities at the DTU party, juxtaposing these with ethnographic field-notes on shifting party atmospheres. Tracing and reflecting on the process of combining heterogeneous data, the article offers a concrete case of how a ‘stitching together’ of digital and ethnographic data-worlds might take place.",
          "This paper argues that analyses of the ways in which Big Data has been enacted in other academic disciplines can provide us with concepts that will help understand the application of Big Data to social questions. We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely.",
          "The use of big data and computational methodologies in social sciences have been getting attention and these changes in methodologies have been declared a \"paradigm shift\" in the contemporary literature. Motivated by such claims, this thesis discusses Computational Social Science by referring to Kuhnian theory of scientific revolutions and emphasizes the emergence of social big data in the former’s rise. Later, a historicization and contextualization of social big data is provided by employing conceptual tools supplied by Jean-François Lyotard and Nigel Thrift to understand and discuss \"scientific change\" in general and the nature of this particular case of scientific change; the rise of computational methodologies.",
          "This chapter looks at the analytical practice of a public sector organization that is at the forefront of research designs, using both evaluation and Big Data approaches. It explores how Big Data techniques can be utilized by government to embrace questions often asked in evaluation studies. The chapter describes Center for Innovation through Data Intelligence (CIDI) and its operations and also describes a concrete application of Big Data and related analytical techniques. It compares the approaches classically applied by evaluators to those applied by CIDI. The chapter explains the challenges created for evaluators by computational social science as applied in Big Data analytics and suggest appropriate professional responses. All evaluation questions that will deal with using a triangulation approach involve the utilization of several data sources to establish robust analyses. A number of public organizations have explored ways that Big Data can support their operations, including the City of New York, the State of Massachusetts, and the European Commission.",
          "Abstract The goal of this chapter is to survey the recent applications of big data in economics and finance. An important advantage of these large alternative datasets is that they provide very detailed information about economic behaviour and decisions which has spurred research aiming at answering long-standing economic questions. Another relevant characteristic of these datasets is that they might be available in real time, a property that can be used to construct economic indicators at high frequencies. Overall, big alternative datasets have the potential to make an impact on economic research and policy and to complement the information used by governmental agencies to produce the official statistics.",
          "As large-scale social data explode and machine-learning methods evolve, scholars of entrepreneurship and innovation face new research opportunities but also unique challenges. This chapter discusses the difficulties of leveraging large-scale data to identify technological and commercial novelty, document new venture origins, and forecast competition between new technologies and commercial forms. It suggests how scholars can take advantage of new text, network, image, audio, and video data in two distinct ways that advance innovation and entrepreneurship research. First, machine-learning models, combined with large-scale data, enable the construction of precision measurements that function as system-level observatories of innovation and entrepreneurship across human societies. Second, new artificial intelligence models fueled by big data generate 'digital doubles' of technology and business, forming laboratories for virtual experimentation about innovation and entrepreneurship processes and policies. The chapter argues for the advancement of theory development and testing in entrepreneurship and innovation by coupling big data with big models.",

This article discusses the use of big data technologies to implement monitoring of social processes. Big data has its characteristics and principles, which reflect here. In addition, we also discussed big data applications in some areas. Particular attention in this article pays to the interactions of big data and sociology. For this, there consider digital sociology and computational social sciences. One of the main objects of study in sociology is social processes. The article shows the types of social processes and their monitoring. As an example, there is implemented monitoring of social processes at the university. There are used following technologies for the realization of social processes monitoring: products 1010data (1010edge, 1010connect, 1010reveal, 1010equities), products of Apache Software Foundation (Apache Hive, Apache Chukwa, Apache Hadoop, Apache Pig), MapReduce framework, language R, library Pandas, NoSQL, etc. Despite this, this article examines the use of the MapReduce model for social processes monitoring at the university."

          "Computational social science is a field of research practices that seeks to predict macroscopic social, economic, and political outcomes by processing the massive amount of \"digital traces\" people produce daily. For at least a few decades now, humans and non-humans have been leaving such traces behind by interacting with computers, by connecting to the Internet, and by allowing their presence and movements in cities to be digitally recorded. In the last decade, computational social science has shifted its focus from the digital space of social media to the analog space of cities and metropolitan regions. The increased digitalization of urban practices, fueled by ubiquitous connectivity and an abundance of connected services, has fostered this transition. Pentland presents one of the very few exceptions to the lack of theory in computational social science. In a series of publications he gives his own account of a theory of innovation, which he bases on empirical studies he has been conducting since the mid-1990s.",
          "The information systems literature has studied digital innovation extensively and focused primarily on its commercial related objectives. Yet, digital social innovations seek to solve social problems, while implementing commercially viable approaches. Drawing from the social entrepreneurship literature and using computational social science methods, we identify the peculiar utilitarian (commercial) and collectivistic (social) identity orientations that shape digital social innovation (DSI). We use a sample of 292 DSI initiatives from Latin America and find that DSIs present both utilitarian and collectivist identity orientation. We also find that the collectivistic identity orientation tends to be more salient in less developed contexts. This allows us to discuss implications for the research on digital social innovation and to open up a discussion on the role of context and possible tensions that may emerge in combining both identity orientations.",
          "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the role of mathematics in the humanities and social sciences, highlighting its growing importance in understanding complex human, social, and cultural phenomena. With the emergence of computational humanities and computational social sciences, mathematical methods such as statistical modelling, network analysis, game theory, and formal simulations have become integral to interdisciplinary research. The study examines core quantitative and computational approaches used across disciplines including economics, sociology, psychology, linguistics, history, archaeology, and digital humanities. It further explores advanced mathematical frameworks such as topological data analysis, information theory, differential equations, and Fourier analysis, demonstrating their applicability in analysing social dynamics, cultural patterns, communication systems, and historical processes. While emphasizing the strengths of mathematical precision, scalability, and predictive capability, the paper also critically discusses challenges related to data complexity, model assumptions, and the distinction between correlation and causation. The study concludes that mathematics does not replace qualitative and interpretive traditions but powerfully complements them, enabling richer, data-driven insights into human behaviour and social structures. The interdisciplinary integration of mathematics is thus positioned as a transformative force shaping the future of humanities and social science research.",

          "There is much we still need to know about social innovation. Where do ideas come from? What resources do they need in order to develop and grow? Why are good ideas blocked or stunted and why sometimes do bad ideas spread? What is the role of social movements, governments, funders and entrepreneurs in generating ideas and taking them to large scale impact? This chapter suggests some of the routes to better answers, addressing: 1. The links between social innovation and new kinds of social science, including their overlap with social R&D as an aspect of policy, including the new opportunities of computational social science, the role of labs and social science parks 2. Analysing sectors as industries in order to guide their shaping, and why this scale of analysis, drawing on industrial economics, may be particularly useful for understanding the dynamics of social innovation. 3. Using data more effectively: and how we may start tracking the growth and evolution of social ideas. 4. Making sense of policy and designing better policies: and what can be learned from the many governments that have over the last decade attempted to support social innovation more directly.",
          "Nanotechnology is expected to have major economic impact over the next decades. Due to its importance, nanotechnology has drawn the attention of policy makers. The huge impact mainly relies on its properties as a general purpose technology (GPT). GPTs can be combined with other technologies, thereby bringing about new innovations and thus feedback effects. If nanotechnology in particular and GPTs in general are of such great importance, effective and efficient policy designs aiming at the fostering of nanotechnology research, development (R&D) and innovation are of vital importance. To design these policies, it is important to understand how GPTs are affecting different technological areas. An empirical study of the knowledge structure of Ireland using social network analysis shows how nanotechnology is connected to the overall knowledge available. We find that nanotechnology is still a rather weakly connected multidisciplinary field however, showing signs of increasingly connecting technology areas in which it is applied.Policy does, however, not exclusively focus on innovations and growth. A recent example is the normative concept of responsible research and innovation, aiming at designing policies, which solve a broader range of societal problems. It is demonstrated that the framework developed can also be used to design research and innovation policies not purely aimed at economic problems. In policy implications it is outlined that due to the great impacts of a GPT on innovation and thus on the economy, normative questions gain even more significance.If policy aims at fostering research and innovation (R&I), it needs to consider the complex nature of R&I, the collaborations in which R&I happens and the relations within such an innovation system. To design efficient policies, these policies can be evaluated before they are introduced by applying computer simulations. With agent-based modelling (ABM) a methodology is available for developing such simulations. At the same time, these computer simulations must can reproduce complex behaviour. An ABM is developed and it is shown that policy questions, here about the importance of heterogeneity can be tackled applying agent-based simulation.With the SKIN (Simulation Knowledge Dynamics in Innovation Networks) a promising tool for R&I policy modelling is identified. Applying a set of indicators, it is shown that the SKIN model in its current form does not capture the emergence and diffusion of GPTs. Subsequently, pathways for adaptations of the model are developed.The work concludes by outlining policy implications and the applicability of the Systems of Innovation approach in connection to the concept of GPTs.",

It is part of a longer project on the political history of “the digital” as a modality of a specific praxis of control. “Prediction Machines” began as an experiment in writing a history of the present with “the backward-directed glance of the historian” that unraveled over time into a genealogy of the state and commercial orchestration of information, prediction, and mediation to control populations.1 In this short essay my focus is on the period from 2007 onwards, but the longer project from which it is drawn unravels backwards to explore the histories of information, governmentality, capital, and control across the deep histories of racialized capitalism. Our present pivots around the years 2007-8. In 2007, for example, research efforts to explore the way information spreads online, and what this information reveals about people, began as a series of collaborative projects between scholars working in computational social sciences (and the emergent field of “psychometrics”) alongside researchers from the U.S. and U.K. military and from digital information technology industries. One of the first experiments created an “Application” on the newly created Facebook platform that gave users a standardized personality test designed to “measure” five significant components of “personality.”2 Users taking the test could opt in to share scores and their Facebook profiles, enabling researchers to correlate “personality” and profile. Over time this meant that “personality type” could be predicted from the information given by people freely to Facebook. “Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior,” the title of a widely cited 2013 paper written collaboratively by researchers in the academy and industry, illustrates concisely the results of the experiment.3 Corresponding research suggested that tabulating what people “Like” on Facebook (after the company introduced the feature in 2009 to gather more lucrative data about people) can accurately predict “traits and attributes.”4 In the midst of this research, beginning in 2008, the Minerva Initiative of the U.S. Department of Defense distributed millions of dollars to support social science research exploring the ways data and influence can be leveraged to facilitate “US strategic interests globally.”5 One of the projects aimed to “develop new dynamic statistical network techniques … that can be leveraged … to alter the distribution of power … or stabilize or destabilize communities.”6 In 2011, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a four-year program exploring “Social Media in Strategic Communication” as part of an expansive re-tooling of “counterinsurgency” and “psychological operations” for the digital era in the ongoing “War on Terror.”7 9/11 in 2001 obviously played a key role in the creation of a new border-security and “data analytics” praxis. In 2012, similarly, the 15 (U.K.) Psychological Operations Group, part of the British military, imported a “Targeted Audience Analysis” methodology developed by a commercial psychological operations organization called Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) into its practices of “counter-terrorism” and “counter-radicalization.”8 In 2013, the patented form of “audience analysis” gathering data to produce predictions about “insurgents” was deployed by the U.K. Defense Science and Technology Laboratory to shape communication and media directed towards young Islamic populations.9 Collectively, this research and practice (henceforth praxis) shared out across academic, corporate, and military institutions and interests gathered pace after 2007 and the birth of “social media” (and indeed the “smartphone”) and demonstrated that the information people give and leave online could reveal “personality” and be used to generate predictions to pre-emptively affect attitudes and conduct. In the process, counterinsurgent “psychological operations” innovated to control dissident (often racialized) populations and ensure the security of “strategic interests” fused with the commercial practices of data extraction and “psychometric” modelling integral to “surveillance” and “platform capitalism” to become routine everyday practices. The “government” of conduct crisscrossed state and commercial praxis. In 2007, to continue the example and exploration of the threads of the history of the present, the commercial psychological operations company SCL was paid by a private U.S. military contractor to develop a “motivation and segmentation profile” of populations in two “lawless” provinces of Yemen.10 Counterinsurgent control (of a state on the borders of oil-rich Saudi Arabia and the Suez Canal shipping route) proceeded through analysis of the country’s communication and media system. In turn, SCL deployed its patented Targeted Audience Analysis “unique behavioral methodology” to “identify” which aspects of the “non-Desired behavior” of the population “can best be challenged.”11 In 2011, the company deployed this methodology to monitor “unrest” across the Middle East during the “Arab Spring,” and in U.K. missions in Libya and Afghanistan.12 In 2013, the same company, growing wealthy from lucrative military contracts in the War on Terror and the control of the “revolt of the public,” was contracted by the Trinidad Ministry of National Security to find ways of predicting crime and disorder.13 Mobilizing its “Targeted Audience Analysis” methodology, SCL operatives tapped directly into the live feeds of the Internet Service Providers in the country and began correlating this data with social media profiles and offline information such as censuses and credit data to discern “personality.” It was a practice of data rendition where the ghost traces of experience were secretly extracted (and exchanged by the company with others in the frantic search for more data) to be rendered into algorithms determining personality and producing predictions about people and security.14 Raw material (in the form of private information) was stolen, extracted, and mined to be processed into the valuable commodity of prediction. Over time, these predictions about personality and conduct were built into self-learning algorithms to trigger the automated sharing of messages and media designed specifically to influence people.15 One other related example. In 2016, a spin-off of SCL (financed by a radical libertarian investment banker and built from Facebook data gathered during the experimental psychometric research emerging from 2007) worked directly alongside Facebook and the Republican Party in the U.S. election of that year to gather data to enable prediction and the automated sharing of media designed to dissuade Black citizens from voting.16 In that same year, 2016, similar practices in the British referendum about membership of the European Union mobilized information to build predictive models to “flood the zone” with around 1.5 billion “dark ads” directed personally to people on Facebook in the last week of the campaign urging citizens to Take Back Control from refugees, migrants, and “globalists.”17 In all these examples, and countless others from around 2007 onwards, information extracted principally from “digital media” produces predictions about the future interest or conduct of populations that triggers media to marshal influence. Crucially, these populations (stretching from “Yemeni terrorists” and “Trinidadian criminals” to “Young British Muslims” and “Black American citizens”) are assumed to lack sovereignty, or the capacity for self-government, and to present problems of security that must be foreclosed by the deployment of information, prediction, and media. Out of this praxis emerged a new paradigm of control.18 It did not begin here, certainly, and one central genealogical thread of the longer project of which this essay is a part traces out connections between imperial counterinsurgency and digital control. But it accelerated and intensified. 2007/8 is the key turning point, after the growth of social media and the research and practice demonstrating its utility for prediction, influence, and control. In the “data rush” that ensued across those two years, Facebook became a “platform”;19 Google spent $3.1 billion to buy a targeted-advertising company that tracked people’s movements across the Internet;20 and the “exceptional” and extraordinarily expansive PRISM project of the U.S. National Security Agency began collecting and analyzing “Internet communication” as a component of the global counterinsurgency project (to foster “security” and “control”) that expanded after 2001 and the declaration of War on Terror.21 In 2008, also, Barack Obama’s “App” was one of the first integrated into the new Facebook platform, making use of the pools of data in the company’s “social graph,” and the success of this sparked the systematic use of the informational, predictive, and influential possibilities of “social media” by political organizations.22 It is certainly a long eight years from Obama’s success in “the first Facebook election” to “Project Alamo” in 2016 using information and media to disenfranchise Black citizens. Or to the circulation of billions of media texts on the Facebook platform using behavioral data and predictive algorithms and designed specifically to mobilize affect (broadly about “security” and “control”) to reorder political and economic reality. Obama’s election in 2008 coincided with the collapse of the financialized economy in the U.S. triggering a global economic crisis and the most recent episode of the “primitive accumulation” of looting, enclosure, and predation ontological to capitalism.23 (In brief, the algorithms offsetting risk failed to discern systemic risk because of the perverse incentives of “sub-prime” mortgages “designed such that they would almost inevitably fail” targeted at poor racialized populations, who had their homes foreclosed, and in response the state bailed out financial entities and enforced austerity on populations.)24 The state bailing out banks and insurance corporations while enforcing austerity on populations was one obvious example of the dictates of liberalism overriding that of democracy, and simple illustration of the reality of capital’s control of government.25 In the years since then, in “the ruins of neo-liberalism,” a bloc of what I shall for the moment call “radical liberals” began using the new affordances of information and mediation to fashion predictive control.26 One simple concrete example is the fore-mentioned spin-off company from the British psychological operations outfit SCL, called Cambridge Analytica, central to “Project Alamo” and the “Brexit” referendum, and financed by a libertarian billionaire hedge-fund CEO waging war against taxation and government.27 In the U.S., and U.K., the principal agendas for a trans-Atlantic libertarian bloc have been the degradation and “deconstruction” of government broadly to foster “freedom” from regulations on capital. Often these radical liberals oppose taxation to contribute to the public good, as well as regulations designed to protect shared environments, and espouse positions opposed to the liberal-democratic paradigm that precariously balanced “liberty” with the “equality” essential to democracy and the operations of popular sovereignty. In the U.S., a radical libertarian praxis grew from the early 1970s in direct opposition to Civil Rights and school desegregation and governmental efforts to facilitate racial equality.28 Put simply, the libertarians oppose the ideal of equality and its political form of democracy and work to disable government projects to foster egalitarianism (like public schooling or health care) and to “protect capitalism from government.”29 In the aftermath of 2008, and the fracturing of economic and political order, a complex transatlantic bloc of libertarian ethno-nationalists opposed to government, equality, and (often incoherently) globalization seized some of the means of informational and mediated control to degrade democracy and shape new political and economic realities. (Broadly, one can see this history as the fracturing of the “neoliberal” order established from the 1970s, which continues in sclerotic and zombie-like fashion, despite its failures and the escalating crises of economic and political order.)30 In 2016, after “Project Alamo” and “Brexit,” the parameters of these practices of informational and mediated control became clearer, and in the years since then journalists, government commissioners, scholars, and filmmakers have explored the myriad ways “bot networks,” “astroturfing,” microtargeting, disinformation, and more, were wielded by blocs of elites to fracture and re-order reality. It bears emphasizing that the battering of the idea and practice of government was a concerted effort, many years in the making, to use capital translated into control of information and media to foster the deregulation of capital in the name of “liberty” and “freedom.” Put bluntly, in the interests of concision, and borrowing from the philosopher Achille Mbembe, we can describe this as a violent “necropolitical” project, part of a “political order … reconstituting itself as a form of organization for death,” that is designed to protect capital at the expense of people and shared environments.31 It has deep roots, of course, across histories of enslavement, imperialism, and capitalism; and it accelerates in the wake of 2008, amid also the pressing realities of climate breakdown, on the back of informational and mediated control.32 Back now to close to the present. After 2016, too, it became clear that the Russian state had also marshaled information and media to shape political reality.33 Once again, these developments pivot around 2007-8, in the wake of the expropriation of the global financial crisis, when Russia trialed cyberwar in Estonia and the Russian president (the fabulously wealthy Vladimir Putin) rewrote the democratic constitution created after the collapse of the Soviet Union to inaugurate what was called a sovereign democracy.34 It was a term invented by an influential “political technologist” to orchestrate the breakdown of democracy and the fashioning of a new autocratic state system.35 In the wake of fraudulent elections in Russia in 2011 and 2012, political technologists fashioned a media strategy to over-write reality and degrade democracy to sustain oligarchic and kleptocratic control of government. In 2013, this praxis was unleashed in Ukraine, when Russia invaded a state on the verge of joining the European Union and practiced “cyberwar” to degrade reality and and dissident and the Russian state began and information and social media in and the U.S. with the to and of on and automated on Russian digital operatives mobilized behavioral data to media to fracture and degrade the of of to that the Russian state had to the same information from Facebook and (and shared widely across data as well as counterinsurgent and to the new practices of psychometric and Often the media using this information to when the the media by the Republican Party in the U.S. with an of the British psychological operations SCL to disenfranchise Black and social other that of reality is now with and as and by wealthy commercial from the circulation and of In the process, the “psychological operations” innovated to sustain and control racialized populations have become and everyday practices. the new digital media that emerged after the U.S. Internet was in the new and created new for the orchestration of information and influence, the control of established that accelerated from 2007 in some of the ways It a in the of reality and One order (broadly that of began to unravel while emerged call it for the moment digital and this with the of the financialized economy and the of the system. war in Ukraine, and the U.S. is one concrete example of this fracturing of global In the wake of these of and media to blocs of elites broadly incoherently) opposed to and have marshaled capital, information, and media to mobilize populations to re-order political and economic reality. is now a racial grew out of this of and It did not begin here, of course, given the of (of imperialism, of violent by to the deep history of capitalism and but it and grew newly at on and radical growing from this violent racial after 2008 and over into reality and of elites from two of the wealthy by the long histories of and imperialism, by the deep histories of across “the integral to the birth and of called for the of new and the creation of to oppose and degrade and war and economic and climate The of the accelerated after in response to and from of war and climate breakdown, European to their borders into and mobilize digital of global and the fashioning of a of … into for of populations, who a of in order to and the of on the borders of and on the of the U.S., as in the expansive fashioning of a and the of population during the early of 2016, the Back was on British populations by operatives using psychometric It was because it people that had been from because it It to reality had the of European in (to to the of European in the early 1970s, in order to the of but the creation of political this reality with and One feature of this was the of to the of a that the way for the of where wealthy investment could the of against the of (the imperial of the its the of 2016, the circulation of billions of media texts in the U.K. targeted using behavioral information was designed by libertarians with close to and transatlantic libertarian to generate and Put simply, it was a “psychological to a on the longer history of imperial counterinsurgency to control racialized populations that was and into a in the “digital amid the War on Terror and the to in some of the ways of these libertarian groups British about information and campaign to generate information and media to foster and degrade One of the groups for to leave the European Union was for its its campaign to and to to but the to because of “political the to orchestrate information and media to to generate and degrade democracy, not to the of the Russian state the breakdown of and has been the by and media despite the that the referendum has and on the and of One could call this a form of sovereign key to the libertarian political project to the political and economic first established to was the out of social democratic regulations on capital (like those related to and while enforcing on the movements of One of the in the network of transatlantic libertarian integral to the political of the present was to in where and out to the and of It is an to from the of government, the for and key to the way capital is in the financial to of the principal for this is the network of in a transatlantic libertarian to the U.K. from (the European social democracy towards with the U.S., “the country of the deployed One of the key for the U.S. in with the European Union is the information about and over time by the National It is a the in of social democracy in the shape of established in after the of populations at and across the to is to be translated into information used to generate by private and Once again, all that is public must into the too, the control of information at the of political power and the of capital.

          "The proliferation of digital data has been the impetus for the emergence of a new discipline for the study of social life: ‘computational social science’. Much research in this field is founded on the premise that society is a complex system with emergent structures that can be modeled or reconstructed through digital data. This paper suggests that computational social science serves practical and legitimizing functions for digital capitalism in much the same way that neoclassical economics does for neoliberalism. In recognition of this homology, this paper develops a critique of the complexity perspective of computational social science and argues for a heterodox computational social science founded on the meta-theory of critical realism that is critical, methodological pluralist, interpretative and explanative. This implies diverting computational social science’ computational methods and digital data so as to not be aimed at identifying invariant laws of social life, or optimizing state and corporate practices, but to instead be used as part of broader research strategies to identify contingent patterns, develop conjunctural explanations, and propose qualitatively different ways of organizing social life.",
          "Statement of the Problem/Background:<br/>Empowered by rapid advances in Business-to-Consumer (B2C) digital infrastructure, consumers are be-ginning to follow an increasingly convoluted path when making purchase decisions for products and ser-vices. They use technologies on B2C match-making platforms to guide their decision journeys in ways that are neither premeditated nor intended. This emergent technology use has remained poorly under-stood within extant literature due to the implicit assumption that consumers adhere to well-defined deci-sion-making processes in which the effectiveness of technologies remains constant regardless of how they are used. <br/><br/>Research Question/Hypothesis: <br/>How do consumers engage in emergent use of the technologies on B2C match-making platforms during their decision journeys? <br/><br/>Research Design and Methods Used in the Investigation: <br/>In this thesis, behavioral analytics, as conceptualized in the computational social sciences field, was em-ployed to empirically validate hypothesized relationships. Process modeling was combined with econo-metrics to analyze emergent technology usage behavior that was embedded in event log data. Essay 1 is devoted to a field experiment conducted with the goal of examining the emergent use of search features on a custom-made restaurant review platform. Three hundred and seventy-seven crowdworkers were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk to participate in the experiment. Essay 2 is an investigation of consumers’ emergent use of platform features based on an analysis of a secondary cruise-booking dataset provided by a major travel-planning platform. This dataset contains 117,218 records of bookings made by 74,557 consumers between 2015 and 2017. <br/><br/>Results/Summary of the Investigation: <br/>The results show that consumers adjust their emergent search strategies to take advantage of the search features that enable them to find the most desirable restaurants. The effectiveness of each emergent search strategy in economizing the costs and maximizing the benefits of a search depends on the goal specificity of the search task. Likewise, consumers make emergent use of eWOM and the cross-channel access provided by travel-planning platforms to rebook their trips. How consumers change their previous bookings can be leveraged to predict whether they will switch companies. Additionally, consumers who rebook appear to be less likely to abandon their purchases and more likely to share their experiences via eWOM. <br/><br/>Interpretation/Conclusion of the Investigation: <br/>The results of this investigation showed that consumers’ emergent technology use is indeed enabled by digital generativities. Moreover, the attention allocation propensity that drives consumers’ emergent use of technologies is the key to predicting the outcome of a consumer decision journey. Future studies can leverage the process-as-propensity approach advanced in this thesis to theorize emergent technology use in various contexts, including those of digital innovation and mixed reality. Empirical findings from this thesis can yield insights for enhancing service marketing and platformization in relation to consumers’ increasingly emergent decision journeys.",
          "Digital infrastructure has been rapidly embraced in the Arab Middle East and North Africa in the last decade, opening a unique window for computational social science and network data science scholars. However, there are currently two coexisting social and economic realities in the region, which result in very different usages and dynamics of networked communication: countries with chronic civil unrest in which digital media have largely served as mobilization tools (e.g., Tunisia, Egypt), and relatively stable and wealthy societies that face social change and economic hyper-development (e.g., Qatar, Kuwait). Given such diversity across the region, how and why should social scientists study digital networks in the Middle East? What can digital networks teach us about the social and political aspects of the modern Middle East? In sum, while claims about digital technologies’ impacts across the region have been critiqued for being speculative and overblown, we suggest that digital technologies have instead broadened our ability to understand ongoing transformations among Arab states and societies.",
          "There is much we still need to know about social innovation. Where do ideas come from? What resources do they need in order to develop and grow? Why are good ideas blocked or stunted and why sometimes do bad ideas spread? What is the role of social movements, governments, funders and entrepreneurs in generating ideas and taking them to large scale impact? This chapter suggests some of the routes to better answers, addressing: 1. The links between social innovation and new kinds of social science, including their overlap with social R & D as an aspect of policy, including the new opportunities of computational social science, the role of labs and social science parks 2. Analysing sectors as industries in order to guide their shaping, and why this scale of analysis, drawing on industrial economics, may be particularly useful for understanding the dynamics of social innovation. 3.

          "According to the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas (CSSSA), computational social science is “The science that investigates social phenomena through the medium of computing and related advanced information processing technologies”. Positioned between the computer and so-cial sciences, this new and emerging interdisciplinary field is fuelled by at least the following two developments: (i) availability of data: With the web, a huge volume of social data is now available which enables the study of traces of social interactions on new scales. (ii) increasing quantifica-tion of social theories: With recent advances in the social sciences, social theories become increasingly formal and/or mathematical and thus amenable to quantification.

          "ICT and the increasing availability of digital data are dramatically changing the processes of research and knowledge production in the social sciences and humanities (SSH). Whereas the methodological momentum in digital humanities and computational social sciences is already immense, theory development in the SSH is much less dynamic and consists mainly of digital resurrections of the classics of our fields. The contributions to this virtual special issue of Technological Forecasting and Social Change do, therefore, not constitute efforts at presenting new social theories of the digital transformation, but rather, efforts at digitally transforming social theory. This introduction presents an overview of the topic and the contributions and outlines key elements of a research agenda on the digital transformation of social theory.",
          "This book explores activism, research and critique in the age of digital subjects and objects and Big Data capitalism after a digital turn said to have radically transformed our political futures. Optimists assert that the â€˜digital' promises: new forms of community and ways of knowing and sensing, innovation, participatory culture, networked activism, and distributed democracy. Pessimists argue that digital technologies have extended domination via new forms of control, networked authoritarianism and exploitation, dehumanization and the surveillance society. Leading international scholars present varied interdisciplinary assessments of such claimsâ€”in theory and via dialogueâ€”and of the digital's impact on society, the potentials, pitfalls, limits and ideologies, of digital activism. They reflect on whether computational social science, digital humanities and ubiquitous datafication lead to digital positivism that threatens critical research or lead to new horizons in theory and society.",

          "Islamophobia remains a pervasive global challenge, necessitating innovative counter-strategies. This study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 1,028 Scopus-indexed publications (2014-2024) examining digital storytelling by the Indonesian Diaspora as a counter-narrative against Islamophobia. Through performance analysis and science mapping using VOSviewer, the research reveals distinct intellectual foundations through co-citation analysis, identifying four key clusters: psychological behavior antecedents, social media marketing, SME digital empowerment, and technology acceptance models. Concurrently, bibliographic coupling analysis uncovers three emerging research fronts focusing on digital technology adoption in education, interdisciplinary sustainability pathways, and e-learning success models. While these frameworks provide valuable theoretical foundations, significant limitations persist, particularly the dominance of technocratic approaches that overlook socio-political complexities in Islamophobic discourse. The study concludes by proposing six critical research agendas: platform-specific algorithm optimization, psychological message framing, cultural brokerage roles, sustainable business models, computational social science applications, and digital diplomacy synergies. These findings not only map the current scholarly landscape but also advocate for more integrated, critical approaches to understanding diaspora-led digital counter-narratives in combating global Islamophobia.",
          "This study illuminates the role of cultural and personal values in shaping connections within online social networks, employing cross-cultural analysis and computational social science. By examining data from eight countries, the investigation underscores how political views, relationship status, and personal priorities significantly influence the number of connections within these networks. Results extend prior research by demonstrating the impact of a broader spectrum of values on network connections. Moreover, the findings show that the relationship between values and network connections varies across cultural contexts, emphasizing the importance of cross-cultural analysis in a globalized world. This study illustrates the potential of computational social science and big data approaches in elucidating complex social phenomena, particularly in understanding the structure of online social networks in the digital age. The findings highlight the necessity of interdisciplinary collaborations between computer science and social science in expanding our comprehension of the digital social world.",
          "This dissertation employs the perspective of library and information science (LIS) to inform and guide methodological reflections in two interdisciplinary fields, computational social science (CSS) and digital humanities (DH). However, CSS often prioritizes recent digital trace data over archival material from earlier periods, and the large-scale methods used in DH face criticism from humanists for their incapability to capture perspectival and interpretative nuances. This dissertation blends humanistic and social-scientific approaches to study premodern China, emphasizing the importance of “moving between scales.” It bridges different scales of analysis by transitioning dynamically between them, examines small-scale structures to uncover how they reflect large-scale dynamics, and explores mid-range social phenomena by investigating prosopography of elite society members. Four research questions are posed: (1) What are the challenges and opportunities in investigating a social network based on biased text? (2) How can prosopographical data lead to conclusions about the shifting center of political power? (3) How can structural characteristics in multiple networks reveal changes in political culture? (4) What can bibliographic metadata reveal about the particularity of publishing history of 16th-to-19th-century Chinese books? By addressing these questions, this dissertation intends to leverage theories and practices of LIS to develop computational models unveiling historical trends. It seeks to contribute to CSS by enhancing social scientists’ understanding on how societies and cultural systems evolve over time, to DH by revealing the historical changes in the longue durée in premodern China, and to LIS by fulfilling its mission of providing an information perspective to traditional academic disciplines.",

          "Abstract Computational Social Science (CSS), which brings together the power of computational methods and the analytical rigour of the social sciences, has the potential to revolutionise policymaking. This growing field of research can help governments take advantage of large-scale data on human behaviour and provide policymakers with insights into where policy interventions are needed, which interventions are most likely to be effective, and how to avoid unintended consequences. In this chapter, we show how Computational Social Science can improve policymaking by detecting, measuring, predicting, explaining, and simulating human behaviour. We argue that the improvements that CSS can bring to government are conditional on making ethical considerations an integral part of the process of scientific discovery. CSS has an opportunity to reveal bias and inequalities in public administration and a responsibility to tackle them by taking advantage of research advancements in ethics and responsible innovation. Finally, we identify the primary factors that prevented Computational Social Science from realising its full potential during the Covid-19 pandemic and posit that overcoming challenges linked to limited data flows, siloed models, and rigid organisational structures within government can usher in a new era of policymaking.",
          "The emerging fields of social computing and computational social science have been driven by the transdisciplinary efforts of scientists, researchers, and scholars from many fields of study. Collaborations across the social, natural, physical, information, computer, mathematical, and health sciences in addition to the humanities have resulted in significant advancements in our understanding of human behavior.",

          "As digital technology has become ubiquitous and more and more data is becoming available in electronic form, The Journal of Digital Islamicate Research (JDIR) will brand itself in academia through a unique approach that integrates computational-social science and humanities. This integration aims to introduce scholars and students to a developing field that is evolving rapidly. The proliferation of digital data presents remarkable opportunities for establishing vigorous collaboration across disciplines to address the “science of culture” through the methods of the new fields including Cultural Analytics and Digital Humanities. These interdisciplinary collaborations are not just beneficial but necessary for advancing our understanding of cultural dynamics in the digital age. By leveraging computational and empirical analysis of social sciences and humanities data, such new fields aim to adapt and refine computational, visualization, and big data methods for the exploration of both contemporary and historical cultures and their products. This adaptation, as explained, for example, in Manovich 2020, is particularly pertinent to the emerging field of Middle Eastern and Islamic Digital Humanities (DH). In this context, JDIR aims to apply advanced digital methodologies to the rich cultural heritage and contemporary cultural practices of the Middle Eastern and Islamic worlds, thus contributing to a deeper, more nuanced understanding of these regions.",
          "It is almost a decade since the article “Computational Social Science” was published in <italic>Science</italic> (Lazer et al., 2009). That article advocated for computational social science as a promising new arrow in the quiver for understanding and enabling social systems. The chapters in this section, and indeed in this book, are a testament to the decade-long trajectory of this movement. The chapters in this section also provide an opportunity to reflect on how computational social science can motivate the development of theories, data, and methods to advance understanding of current and emerging forms of communication and organizational dynamics. This chapter reviews some of the progress made on these dimensions and points to chapters in the section that serve as exemplars.",
          "Digital methods have emerged as a critical approach for investigating social phenomena in environments deeply mediated by digital technologies. Although they are often associated with digital humanities or computational social sciences, they constitute an increasingly relevant area of research. Based on 831 publications retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO, this study identifies the main thematic lines, key authors, institutions, and countries contributing to the field. The results show sustained growth since 2017, a high concentration of publications in Q1 journals, and a notable citation impact. They also highlight the centrality of the Global North, limited participation from the Global South, and the coexistence of critical, computational, and exploratory approaches. Far from presenting a homogeneous identity, digital methods emerge as a constellation of research practices, marked by epistemic, geographic, and linguistic tensions. This study thus offers an empirical overview of their consolidation as an interdisciplinary field.",
          "The contemporary prevalence of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods has resulted in a rich literature on the factors that shape computational research. This article draws on the laboratory studies literature to examine how platforms’ socio-technical infrastructures shape contemporary computational social science research. Based on 18 months of online ethnography of a university laboratory and 15 in-depth interviews with its researchers, the article makes two main arguments. First, for computational social sciences, platforms function as laboratories where the social is selectively carved and transformed, to make it knowable with computational methods. Thus, it makes the case that platforms manufacture the objects of analysis in computational social research and provide the social as a domain. Second, because of the significance of social media platforms as data laboratories for computational research, in contrast to the claims of data sciences to be domainless, these sciences may derive some of their epistemological and occupational power, as well as their cultural authority, from digital capitalism."

          "No other topic has stirred up as much controversy and division as the ethics of computational social science research. For one, massive amounts of data are readily available for download in the form of digital trace data on individuals and their interactions, providing opportunities for unprecedented insight into social science research questions. Complicating matters is that developments in computational approaches and methods are rapid, while policy, legal frameworks, ethics guidelines, and pedagogy lag behind. In this chapter, we discuss four major challenges that computational social science scholars confront with regard to ethical questions and dilemmas, often linked to data interpretation and user privacy: 1) data representativity, 2) aggregation and disaggregation, 3) research data archiving, and 4) data linkage. In addition, we also provide a roadmap for computational social science scholars to address these issues using best practices informed by exemplary research. We conclude by stressing the relevance of building on existing ethics guidelines and integrating new legal frameworks into research practice. We argue that central to computational social science is a constant engagement with ethics and new regulations as well as an active commitment to pedagogy, to teaching the principles of ethics in computational social science projects.",
          "Computational social science research, particularly online studies, often involves exposing participants to the adverse phenomenon the researchers aim to study. Examples include presenting conspiracy theories in surveys, exposing systems to hackers, or deploying bots on social media. We refer to these as \"social challenge studies,\" by analogy with medical research, where challenge studies advance vaccine and drug testing but also raise ethical concerns about exposing healthy individuals to risk. Medical challenge studies are guided by established ethical frameworks that regulate how participants are exposed to agents under controlled conditions. In contrast, social challenge studies typically occur with less control and fewer clearly defined ethical guidelines. In this paper, we examine the ethical frameworks developed for medical challenge studies and consider how their principles might inform social research. Our aim is to initiate discussion on formalizing ethical standards for social challenge studies and encourage long-term evaluation of potential harms.",
          "Data-driven research is increasingly ubiquitous and data itself is a defining asset for researchers, particularly in the computational social sciences and humanities. Entire careers and research communities are built around valuable, proprietary or sensitive datasets. However, many existing computation resources fail to support secure and cost-effective storage of data while also enabling secure and flexible analysis of the data. To address these needs we present CLOUD KOTTA, a cloud-based architecture for the secure management and analysis of social science data. CLOUD KOTTA leverages reliable, secure, and scalable cloud resources to deliver capabilities to users, and removes the need for users to manage complicated infrastructure. CLOUD KOTTA implements automated, cost-aware models for efficiently provisioning tiered storage and automatically scaled compute resources. CLOUD KOTTA has been used in production for several months and currently manages approximately 10TB of data and has been used to process more than 5TB of data with over 75,000 CPU hours. It has been used for a broad variety of text analysis workflows, matrix factorization, and various machine learning algorithms, and more broadly, it supports fast, secure and cost-effective research.",
          "The use of bots as virtual confederates in online field experiments holds extreme promise as a new methodological tool in computational social science. However, this potential tool comes with inherent ethical challenges. Informed consent can be difficult to obtain in many cases, and the use of confederates necessarily implies the use of deception. In this work we outline a design space for bots as virtual confederates, and we propose a set of guidelines for meeting the status quo for ethical experimentation. We draw upon examples from prior work in the CSCW community and the broader social science literature for illustration. While a handful of prior researchers have used bots in online experimentation, our work is meant to inspire future work in this area and raise awareness of the associated ethical issues.",
          "As online communities have grown, Computational Social Science has rapidly developed new techniques to study them. However, these techniques require researchers to become experts in a wide variety of tools in addition to qualitative and computational research methods. Studying online communities also requires researchers to constantly navigate highly contextual ethical and transparency considerations when engaging with data, such as respecting their members' privacy when discussing sensitive or stigmatized topics. To overcome these challenges, we developed the Computational Thematic Analysis Toolkit, a modular software package that supports analysis of online communities by combining aspects of reflexive thematic analysis with computational techniques. Our toolkit demonstrates how common analysis tasks like data collection, cleaning and filtering, modelling and sampling, and coding can be implemented within a single visual interface, and how that interface can encourage researchers to manage ethical and transparency considerations throughout their research process.",
          "Abstract To better understand how engineering students think about ethics across cultures, and improve education in engineering ethics on this basis, a website was developed to host educational contents and conduct research. The site can facilitate large-scale, qualitative research using methods employed by the computational social sciences and digital humanities. To demonstrate its potential value, this paper describes a preliminary study using network analysis and semantic maps to explore the responses of engineering students (N=70) in China to two course-related prompts: give an example of a behavior you consider unethical; explain what makes this behavior unethical. Preliminary results seem to suggest that engineering students in China conceive of unethical behaviors as ones where companies negatively affect people through their products, and that the harmful, other-regarding nature of these behaviors is what makes them unethical. The implications of these results are discussed, as well as shortcomings of the current study and directions for future work.",
          "The questions we can ask currently, building on decades of research, call for advanced methods and understanding. We now have large, complex data sets that require more than complex statistical analysis to yield human answers. Yet as some researchers have pointed out, we also have challenges, especially in computational social science. In a recent project I faced several such challenges and eventually realized that the relevant issues were familiar to users of free and open-source software. I needed a team with diverse skills and knowledge to tackle methods, theories, and topics. We needed to iterate over the entire project: from the initial theories to the data to the methods to the results. We had to understand how to work when some data was freely available but other data that might benefit the research was not. More broadly, computational social scientists may need creative solutions to slippery problems, such as restrictions imposed by terms of service for sites from which we wish to gather data. Are these terms legal, are they enforced, or do our institutional review boards care? Lastly—perhaps most importantly and dauntingly—we may need to challenge laws relating to digital data and access, although so far this conflict has been rare. Can we succeed as open-source advocates have?",
          "We discuss how computational social scientists can achieve high standards of accessibility, transparency, replicability, and reproducibility by adhering to four open science principles: open practices, open data, open tools, and open access. For each principle, we discuss the underlying motivation, challenges, and potential solutions for computational social scientists. Open practices refer to honest and transparent specification of all steps in the data processing and data analysis. We recommend that computational social scientists share their materials and analysis scripts. Open data refers to data that are publicly available, and we urge computational social scientists to share their data whenever possible. When data cannot be shared, researchers ought to be explicit about the conditions of its availability. Open tools refer to software that is both free and has its source code available to others. We recommend that computational social scientists share their code, software, and educational materials whenever possible so that other people can learn computational techniques. Finally, open access is making the products of one's research process publicly available. We encourage computational social scientists to use open-access outlets for the ultimate publication of work when feasible and to self-archive their research products regardless.",
          "Managers regularly face a complex ethical dilemma over how to best govern online communities by evaluating the effectiveness of different social or technical strategies. What ethical considerations should guide researchers and managers when they employ causal research methods that make different community members bear different risks and benefits, under different levels of consent? We introduce a structural framework for evaluating the flows of risks and benefits in social systems with multiple interacting parties. This framework has implications for understanding the governmentality of managing socio-technical systems, for making research ethics discussions more commensurable, and for enumerating alternative goals researchers might pursue with interventions.",
          "Computational social science has expanded the capacity of scientists to study connected human behavior at previously unprecedented scales. Yet from its beginning, scientists expressed concern that its reliance on private companies might produce a body of work that cannot be critiqued or replicated. Such commercial determinants of science have been observed in other fields including public health where science has implications for corporate liability. In this meta-scientific report, we analyze articles published in general scientific journals to investigate commercial determinants of scientific replicability in computational social science. We find that 34% of computational social science studies published in leading general scientific journals rely on special arrangements with corporations that are impossible to replicate without special permission. We find that articles relying on API access, scraping or access to nonprofit platforms have much higher potential for replication. These findings are consistent with broader literature on the commercial forces that determine the direction and reliability of science.",

          "Computational social science uses computational and statistical methods in order to evaluate social interaction. The public availability of data sets is thus a necessary precondition for reliable and replicable research. These data allow researchers to benchmark the computational methods they develop, test the generalizability of their findings, and build confidence in their results. When social media data are concerned, data sharing is often restricted for legal or privacy reasons, which makes the comparison of methods and the replicability of research results infeasible. Social media analytics research, consequently, faces an integrity crisis. How is it possible to create trust in computational or statistical analyses, when they cannot be validated by third parties? In this work, we explore this well-known, yet little discussed, problem for social media analytics. We investigate how this problem can be solved by looking at related computational research areas. Moreover, we propose and implement a prototype to address the problem in the form of a new evaluation framework that enables the comparison of algorithms without the need to exchange data directly, while maintaining flexibility for the algorithm design.",
          "The development of the web, in the last 20 years, has opened new areas of analysis and new phenomena sociologically relevant for social research. However, the research work in digital space presents a series of ethical and deontological problems.

          "During the last few years a growing amount of content produced by Internet users has become publicly available online. These data come from a variety of places, including popular social web services like Facebook and Twitter, consumer services like Amazon or weblogs. The research opportunities opened up by this socio-technological innovation are, as shown by the growing literature on the topic, huge. At the same time new challenges for social scientists arise. In this paper we will focus on two of the main challenges posed to the growth of the so-called computational social science: interdisciplinarity and ethics. While the searchability and persistence of this information make it ideal for sociological research, a quantitative approach is still challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. Collecting, storing and analyzing these data often require technical skills beyond the traditional curricula of social scientists. These projects require, in fact, collaboration with computer scientists. Nevertheless developing a common interdisciplinary project is often challenging because of the different backgrounds of the researchers. At the same time the availability of this content poses a challenge concerning privacy and research ethics. Due to the amount of data and the fact that the real identity of the author is often hidden behind a nickname, it is often impossible to ask the subject involved to consent to the use of their data. On the other hand, especially in the first wave of web 2.0, this information has been – intentionally or not – publicly shared by the users. While a technique of dis-embedding the identity of the user from the content analyzed is often the solution used to bypass this issue, an even more important privacy-related challenge for computational social science is emerging. Due to the wide adoption of social network sites such Facebook or Google+, where a user may decide to share his content with his/her group of friends only, the amount of public data will change and decrease in the future. We will discuss this issue by enumerating a number of possible future scenarios.",

          "With the increasing popularity of computational approaches to conduct social science research, building a scalable and efficient computing platform has become a topic of interest for academia to empower research labs and institutes to analyze large-scale data. While social science researchers have been very excited about the advancement of emerging technologies in big data, deep learning, computer vision, network analysis, etc., they are also constrained by the available computing resources to analyze data. This paper describes a scalable solution to deploy JupyterHub for computational social science research on the cloud. We use a reference architecture on AWS to walk through the design principles and details. Our architecture has helped facilitate several collaborations between Facebook and academia.

          "Recital 33 GDPR has often been interpreted as referring to ‘broad consent’. This version of informed consent was intended to allow data subjects to provide their consent for certain areas of research, or parts of research projects, conditional to the research being in line with ‘recognised ethical standards’. In this article, we argue that broad consent is applicable in the emerging field of Computational Social Science (CSS), which lies at the intersection of data science and social science. However, the lack of recognised ethical standards specific to CSS poses a practical barrier to the use of broad consent in this field and other fields that lack recognised ethical standards. Upon examining existing research ethics standards in social science and data science, we argue that they are insufficient for CSS. We further contend that the fragmentation of European Union (EU) law and research ethics sources makes it challenging to establish universally recognised ethical standards for scientific research. As a result, CSS researchers and other researchers in emerging fields that lack recognised ethical standards are left without sufficient guidance on the use of broad consent as provided for in the GDPR. We conclude that responsible EU bodies should provide additional guidance to facilitate the use of broad consent in CSS research.",

We elaborate on the challenges and asymmetries mentioned by Sandvig — such as those related to legal issues and the disparity between early-career and senior researchers. We also contribute a discussion of the asymmetries that were not covered by Sandvig but that we find critically important: those related to other disparities between researchers, incentive structures related to the access to data from companies, targets of auditing and users and their rights. We also discuss the implications these asymmetries have for algorithm auditing research such as the Western-centrism and the lack of the diversity of perspectives.

          "In their Policy Forum “Computational social science: Obstacles and opportunities” (28 August, p. [1060][1]), D. M. J. Lazer et al. propose ethical data infrastructures for computational social science research. Concentrating on access to platform trace data, they dismiss third-party market data from such companies as Nielsen and comScore because of “opaque” methods and high cost. We believe both have virtues, but their proper use requires a keener appreciation of each measurement regime.\n\nAll data result from measurement processes designed and executed to serve a given institutional context ([ 1 ][2], [ 2 ][3]). Platforms profit from shaping usage and they measure toward that end. Using their trace data to understand human conduct remains problematic as long as platforms are themselves opaque about their methods for managing user behavior ([ 3 ][4]). Social Science One and Twitter's COVID-19 application programming interface may be productive precedents of platform data provision, but computational social science should reckon with the effects of platform measurement.\n\nUnlike platforms, third-party measurement firms are not invested in how users behave. As with public-sector data (such as the U.S. Census), third-party measurement is periodically audited ([ 4 ][5]). Its procedures and consequences are constantly appraised by actors with competing interests ([ 5 ][6]). Serving industries, policy-makers, and academics, third-party market research has invested for decades in refining what Lazer et al. aspire to: “an administrative infrastructure… enforcing compliance with privacy and ethics rules,” which aligns “with critical research norms” including “transparency, reproducibility, replication, and consent” ([ 3 ][4], [ 6 ][7], [ 7 ][8]).\n\nThird-party measurement firms such as Nielsen and comScore supply data to a broad subscriber base of advertising agencies and content publishers, which lowers data costs. Academic institutions worldwide may access numerous such third-party datasets via Wharton Research Data Services and Chicago Booth, brokers that partner with third-party firms for this purpose. Meanwhile, public data can be cost prohibitive (such as CDC's National Death Index).\n\nWhat ensures data's “public accountability” is not a public-sector origin but how the measurement regime is institutionally arranged ([ 3 ][4]). In addition to expanding data collaborations and data infrastructures, attention to the measurement regimes of “found data” and reflexive triangulation across data sources are indispensable to development of computational social science.\n\n1.

          "<sec> <title>UNSTRUCTURED</title> When Reddit and Twitter announced they are shutting down their application programming interfaces, the ability for computational social scientists to research online human behavior was severely impacted. But this has been a long time coming. Unlike ten years ago, the social media landscape stretches beyond Facebook and Twitter to TikTok, SnapChat, and Instagram. Parent companies often have divergent views of data use and API access. Moreover, we don’t expect financial institutions to hand out anonymized data, why would we (legally) expect the same from tech companies? While sharing data was an unspoken agreement, this was more business ethos than legal obligation. The recent Meta meta-studies on the 2020 Presidential Elections present a grim view of access (Wagner, 2023). Meta reached out to select researchers to pilot a new paradigm of social science research– Meta provided the data, and two leads picked researchers to conduct an independent analysis. Four years later, over 15 studies have been produced from these data. Though an incredible feat of science, this model of “independence by permission” where select researchers conduct research has called into scrutiny paradigms for online research. A growing trend may provide an alternative. Media Intelligence is the growing industry of collecting and analyzing billions of online conversations to drive business decisions. For researchers, this presents an opportunity. Over the past three years, our team based at the University of Southern California tracked influencers who post about e-cigarette products across multiple platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. We began working completely in-house then transitioned to collaboration with media intelligence companies. Our project measures the portrayal of e-cigarette products on social media and their impact on adolescent tobacco use. It includes multiple components– training deep learning models to identify the age, gender, and e-cigarette; conducting social network analysis; surveying adolescents about their exposure to tobacco. The biggest hurdle for our work is the very first step– data acquisition. Once the Instagram API retired, it was very difficult to scrape posts, captions, comments, and metadata. That’s when we chanced upon Meltwater, the first media intelligence company. Already, they provided enough data to publish profiling influencers. However, this merely provided a starting point. Once we identified the influencers, we proceeded to scrape their posts and social networks. By relying on pre-identified influencers, we skipped the resource-extensive task of scouring the platforms to find the most influential users. One weakness to this approach lies in the proprietary nature of commercial metrics. We do not know the parameters Klear uses, which may have downstream implications for replicability. We assuaged this with manual audits on each suggested profile. If these services can provide an explanation of their method, this would lend to greater transparency. As influencer marketing tactics mature and API access declines, the capabilities of data brokers will grow. What matters is leveraging targeted services as stepping stones toward answering meaningful research questions. The days of free data may be over, but researchers may find a reasonable substitute via “independence by competition” in the market of data brokers. </sec>",
          "The growing use of social media field experiments demands a rethink of current research ethics in computational social science. Here, we provide an empirical account of key user concerns and outline a number of critical discussions that need to take place to protect participants and help researchers to make use of the novel opportunities of digital data collection and field studies. Our primary contention is that we need to elicit public perceptions to devise more up-to-date guidelines for review boards whilst also allowing and encouraging researchers to arrive at more ethical individual study design choices themselves. We conclude by discussing how we can better strike a balance between meeting ethical guidelines and the concerns of social media users alongside maximizing scientific impact and credibility.",
          "<b>Background:</b> Computational Social Science (CSS) utilizes large digital datasets and computational methods to study human behavior, raising ethical concerns about data privacy, informed consent, and potential misuse.<b>Methods:</b> This study employs a constructivist grounded theory approach, analyzing 15 in-depth interviews with CSS practitioners in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. These countries share a European legal context regarding data privacy and hereby provide a comparable regulatory environment for examining ethical considerations.<b>Results:</b> Findings highlight key challenges in CSS research, including power imbalances with data providers, uncertainties around surveillance and data privacy (especially with longitudinal data), and limitations of current ethics frameworks. Researchers face tensions between established ethical principles and practical realities, often feeling disempowered and lacking support from ethics boards due to their limited CSS expertise. Regulatory ambiguity further discourages research due to fear of sanctions.<b>Conclusions:</b> To foster responsible CSS practices, this paper recommends establishing specialized ethics boards with CSS expertise. It also advocates for acknowledging CSS's unique nature in research policy by developing tailored data guidelines and providing legal certainty through clear guidelines. Grounding recommendations in practitioners' experiences, this study offers actionable steps to help enable ethical CSS research.",
          "The online space has become a digital public square, where individuals interact and share ideas on the most trivial to the most serious of matters, including discussions of controversial ethical issues in science, technology and medicine. In the last decade, new disciplines like computational social science and social data science have created methods to collect and analyse such data that have considerably expanded the scope of social science research. Empirical bioethics can benefit from the integration of such digital methods to investigate novel digital phenomena and trace how bioethical issues take shape online. Here, using concrete examples, we demonstrate how novel methods based on digital approaches in the social sciences can be used effectively in the domain of bioethics. We show that a digital turn in bioethics research aligns with the established aims of empirical bioethics, integrating with normative analysis and expanding the scope of the discipline, thus offering ways to reinforce the capacity of bioethics to tackle the increasing complexity of present-day ethical issues in science and technology. We propose to call this domain of research in bioethics digital bioethics .",
          "Abstract During the past four decades, the role of trust in the economy has gained increasing attention beginning with economist Kenneth Arrow's contention that trust is the lubricant of the economy increasing efficiency and saving on transactions costs. It is also important in the political realm, facilitating collective action. Robert Putnam, among others, contends that trust, as one component of social capital, is a key factor in the vibrancy of civil society. Both economists and social psychologists have used game theory and experimental methods to investigate trust and reciprocity. A key question remains How is trust maintained in the absence of monitoring, especially in the case of principal–agent relations? Economic historians and anthropologists have identified several mechanisms that serve to facilitate trust‐based interactions across space and time. In the context of organizations and management, a wide range of trust‐related issues have been explored, especially in the wake of Enron (a company no longer in existence) and the more recent failure of investment banks and other large financial institutions. At the macro‐level, Francis Fukuyama, among others, has explored the cultural underpinnings of differences in levels of general trust in various societies and its consequences for economic development. More recently, trust has become a central theme in the study of the sharing economy in which an astonishing array of goods and services is now offered by auction or exchange on the Internet. Detailed research on such enterprises (e.g., eBay, CouchSurfing, and AirBnB) is now possible through the development of computational social science.",
          "The use of bots as virtual confederates in online field experiments holds extreme promise as a new methodological tool in computational social science. However, this potential tool comes with inherent ethical challenges. Informed consent can be difficult to obtain in many cases, and the use of confederates necessarily implies the use of deception. In this work we outline a design space for bots as virtual confederates, and we propose a set of guidelines for meeting the status quo for ethical experimentation. We draw upon examples from prior work in the CSCW community and the broader social science literature for illustration. While a handful of prior researchers have used bots in online experimentation, our work is meant to inspire future work in this area and raise awareness of the associated ethical issues.",
          "The development of the web, in the last 20 years, has opened new areas of analysis and new phenomena sociologically relevant for social research. However, the research work in digital space presents a series of ethical and deontological problems. In this context the members of the Association of Internet Researchers (AOIR) have composed and edited a document with a series of ethical guidelines for social research. The work of the AOIR group not include Italian researchers; for this reason, the aim of this paper is propose a commented translation of the contents of Ethical decision-making and Internet research for make the ethical factor one of the main tools for computational sociology.",
          "Data-driven research is increasingly ubiquitous and data itself is a defining asset for researchers, particularly in the computational social sciences and humanities. Entire careers and research communities are built around valuable, proprietary or sensitive datasets. However, many existing computation resources fail to support secure and cost-effective storage of data while also enabling secure and flexible analysis of the data. To address these needs we present CLOUD KOTTA, a cloud-based architecture for the secure management and analysis of social science data. CLOUD KOTTA leverages reliable, secure, and scalable cloud resources to deliver capabilities to users, and removes the need for users to manage complicated infrastructure.CLOUD KOTTA implements automated, cost-aware models for efficiently provisioning tiered storage and automatically scaled compute resources.CLOUD KOTTA has been used in production for several months and currently manages approximately 10TB of data and has been used to process more than 5TB of data with over 75,000 CPU hours. It has been used for a broad variety of text analysis workflows, matrix factorization, and various machine learning algorithms, and more broadly, it supports fast, secure and cost-effective research.",
          "Consumer-based datasets are the products of data brokerage firms that agglomerate millions of personal records on the adult US population. This big data commodity is purchased by both companies and individual clients for purposes such as marketing, risk prevention, and identity searches. The sheer magnitude and population coverage of available consumer-based datasets and the opacity of the business practices that create these datasets pose emergent ethical challenges within the computational social sciences that have begun to incorporate consumer-based datasets into empirical research. To directly engage with the core ethical debates around the use of consumer-based datasets within social science research, I first consider two case study applications of consumer-based dataset-based scholarship. I then focus on three primary ethical dilemmas within consumer-based datasets regarding human subject research, participant privacy, and informed consent in conversation with the principles of the seminal Belmont Report.",
          "As researchers increasingly engage with ethically complex digital phenomena, timely and accessible support for ethical reflection is essential---yet often unavailable beyond formal institutional review processes, which are more focused on regulatory compliance than ethics. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as research ethics support tools by providing immediate, context-sensitive feedback on draft research protocols. We analyze a draft research proposing to scrape digital platforms for data on ``Sephora Kids''---a trend in which minors promote beauty products on platforms like YouTube and TikTok---as a case study to explore this possibility. Two human ethicists and two LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) independently reviewed the proposal and produced ethical evaluations. We then compared the outputs to assess whether LLMs could meaningfully assist researchers in identifying and engaging with ethical issues. Our findings suggest that LLMs can already offer valuable support."

          "This volume arrives at an important inflection point in the relationship between law and computation. Technological, scientific, and methodological developments are increasingly allowing computation to provide not just efficiencies in the traditional ways we practice or study the law, but new perspectives on the law and potential paradigmatic shifts in how we think about and understand it. These developments have already been major factors in the recent evolution of many other academic fields, as evidenced for example by the rise of computational social science, computational biology, the digital humanities, and many more emerged and still-emerging subdisciplines. Although law has perhaps lagged somewhat behind its peer disciplines in adopting and adapting computational research methods, that has begun to change in recent years as more and more legal scholars have begun applying computational methods in the course of their research. This volume explores this emergence of computational legal studies by presenting a variety of research that is either representative of, or in conversation with, the field. Before setting out to explore the state of computational legal studies, it is important first to provide at least a general delineation of what it might include and exclude. Computers and the law intersect in a variety of ways, none of which is entirely independent of one another, but all of which benefit from being independently identified in a discussion about computational legal studies. Perhaps the most common association between computers and the law is the substantive law that is increasingly faced with questions that arise as society becomes more and more digitally mediated. This area of study and practice is sometimes referred to as cyberlaw, and extends to a diverse set of legal areas including free expression, cybersecurity, privacy, and more. Although cyberlaw is broad in the legal areas it extends to, its scholarship is united by the central relevance of technology and technologically mediated social behavior to the questions it explores.",
          "A group of prominent researchers recently introduced Computational Social Science (CSS) in a Nature article, highlighting its potential with a call for more institutional support. The companion composed by prevalent researchers sees no scientific limitations in CSS. However, this paper argues that despite CSS's popularity, it harbors scientific, methodological and philosophical shortcomings leading to a form of academic authoritarianism, highly consequential for Higher Education. It evaluates critically its impact on Management Science, Public Policy, and Social Development. While CSS appears promising, its current trajectory fails to deliver substantial innovation and leadership, misleading both leaders and policymakers. The paper advocates for alternative approaches within CSS, more useful for Higher Education and societal advancement.",
          "In the last 20 years, the convergence of different factors—the rise of the complexity of science, the “data deluge” and the advances in information technologies—triggered a paradigm shift in the way we understand complex social systems and their evolution. Beyond shedding new light onto social dynamics, the emerging research area of Computational Social Science (CSS) is providing a new rationale for a more scientifically-grounded and effective policy design. The paper discusses the opportunities potentially deriving from the intersection between policy design issues and CSS methods. After a general introduction to the limits of traditional policy-making and a brief review of the most promising CSS methodologies, the work deals with way in which the insights potentially offered by CSS can concretely flow in policy choices. The attention is focused, to this end, on the legal mechanisms regulating the formulation and the evaluation of public policies. Our goal is two-fold: sketch how the project of a “smart society” is connected to the evolution of social sciences and emphasize the need for change in the way in which public policies are conceived of, designed and implemented.",

Against these exciting developments stands a stubborn fact: that in spite of many thousands of published papers, there has been surprisingly little progress on the big questions that motivated the field in the first place?questions concerning systemic risk in financial systems, problem solving in complex organizations, and the dynamics of epidemics or social movements, among others. In this talk I highlight some examples of research that would not have been possible just a handful of years ago and that illustrate the promise of CSS. At the same time, they illustrate its limitations. I then conclude with some thoughts on how CSS can bridge the gap between its current state and its potential.",
          "Over the past decades, social sciences have gradually learned to use quantitative methods and computational tools. According to the emerging paradigm of  so called “computational social science” (CSS), the study of social phenomena is more and more often identified with the use of statistical and analytical tools, with data mining techniques and with the construction of simulation models, in other words, with computation. Law has substantially fallen behind in exploiting the methodological and scientific outcomes of CSS research. The ongoing change though should involve legal culture for at least two reasons. Firstly, the making, interpretation and application of legal rules conceived to regulate social life cannot ignore the scientific knowledge and methodologies illuminating social dynamics at both individual and collective level. Secondly, CSS are going to provide lawyers with methods and tools offering new scientific basis to their findings and their concrete choices in applying and interpreting law. The goal of the paper is twofold: on the one hand, to present CSS and discuss, in general terms, how it can positively influence law, offering to lawyers new tools and approaches for addressing legal problems; on the other hand, to focus on one of the most interesting research sectors that can take advantage from CSS approaches: the study of support methodologies and tools for policy making.",
          "Puberty is a phase in which individuals often test the boundaries of themselves and surrounding others and further define their identity - and thus their uniqueness compared to other individuals. Similarly, as Computational Social Science (CSS) grows up, it must strike a balance between its own practices and those of neighboring disciplines to achieve scientific rigor and refine its identity. However, there are certain areas within CSS that are reluctant to adopt rigorous scientific practices from other fields, which can be observed through an overreliance on passively collected data (e.g., through digital traces, wearables) without questioning the validity of such data. This paper argues that CSS should embrace the potential of combining both passive and active measurement practices to capitalize on the strengths of each approach, including objectivity and psychological quality. Additionally, the paper suggests that CSS would benefit from integrating practices and knowledge from other established disciplines, such as measurement validation, theoretical embedding, and open science practices. Based on this argument, the paper provides ten recommendations for CSS to mature as an interdisciplinary field of research.",

          "Computational social science (CSS) is an evolving field with transformative potential to expose and address pressing societal challenges. Yet, because CSS, much like other scientific disciplines, operates within structural contexts addressing social bias remains a critical issue requiring attention in the field. Social bias, defined as the systematic discrimination and stereotyping of groups and individuals, relates to CSS in multiple ways. Drawing on literature, we critically examine these connections across three perspectives: understanding, detecting, and mitigating social bias. First, we provide a foundation for understanding how social bias shapes both CSS as a research field and its methodology. Second, we highlight how social bias can be detected not only within the CSS methodology itself but also through CSS applied to broader societal domains. Finally, moving forward, we propose strategies to mitigate social bias in the CSS methodology and CSS as a research field. With our contribution, we seek to demonstrate the breadth of ways in which social bias and CSS intersect and to chart paths toward a more equitable and robust CSS.",
          "We present a comprehensive study on the emergence of Computational Social Science (CSS) - an interdisciplinary field leveraging computational methods to address social science questions - and its impact on adjacent social sciences. We trained a robust CSS classifier using papers from CSS-focused venues and applied it to 11 million papers spanning 1990 to 2021. Our analysis yielded three key findings. First, there were two critical inflections in the rise of CSS. The first occurred around 2005 when psychology, politics, and sociology began engaging with CSS. The second emerged in approximately 2014 when economics finally joined the trend. Sociology is currently the most engaged with CSS. Second, using the density of yearly knowledge embeddings constructed by advanced transformer models, we observed that CSS initially lacked a cohesive identity. From the early 2000s to 2014, however, it began to form a distinct cluster, creating boundaries between CSS and other social sciences, particularly in politics and sociology. After 2014, these boundaries faded, and CSS increasingly blended with the social sciences. Third, shared data-driven methods homogenized CSS papers across disciplines, with politics and economics showing the most alignment due to the combined influence of CSS and causal identification. Nevertheless, non-CSS papers in sociology, psychology, and politics became more divergent. Taken together, these findings highlight the dynamics of division and unity as new disciplines emerge within existing knowledge landscapes.

Further, we believe that with the addition of a specific and novel object of research, as well as a body of unique theories, terminologies, and specialist knowledge, CSS may also act as an academic discipline, or at least be central to social science research in higher education.",
          "Abstract This chapter is concerned with setting up practical guardrails within the research activities and environments of Computational Social Science (CSS). It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the incorporation of end-to-end habits of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols.",

          "Computational Social Science (CSS) increasingly engages in critical discussions about bias in and through computational methods. Two developments drive this shift: first, the recognition of bias as a societal problem, as flawed CSS methods in socio-technical systems can perpetuate structural inequalities; and second, the field’s growing methodological resources, which create not only the opportunity but also the responsibility to confront bias. In this editorial to our Special Issue on CSS and bias, we introduce the contributions and outline a research agenda. In defining bias, we emphasize the importance of embracing epistemological pluralism while balancing the need for standardization with methodological diversity. Detecting bias requires stronger integration of bias detection into validation procedures and the establishment of shared metrics and thresholds across studies. Finally, addressing bias involves adapting established and emerging error-correction strategies from social science traditions to CSS, as well as leveraging bias as an analytical resource for revealing structural inequalities in society. Moving forward, progress in defining, detecting, and addressing bias will require both bottom-up engagement by researchers and top-down institutional support. This Special Issue positions bias as a central theme in CSS – one that the field now has both the tools and the obligation to address.",

We end with a set of conclusions and suggestions for future research directions.",
          "As a quintessential <em>social impact science</em>, Computational Social Science (CSS) holds great promise to advance social justice, human flourishing, and biospheric sustainability. However, CSS is also an all-too-human science—conceived in particular social, cultural, and historical contexts and pursued amidst intractable power imbalances, structural inequities, and potential conflicts of interest. Its proponents must thus remain continuously self-critical about the role that values, interests, and power dynamics play in shaping mission-driven research. Likewise, they must take heed of the complicated social and historical conditions surrounding the generation and construction of data as well as the way that the activities and theories of CSS researchers can function to restructure and shape the phenomena that they purport only to measure and analyse. This article is concerned with setting up practical guardrails within the research activities and environments of CSS in response to these dilemmas. It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as a motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the end-to-end incorporation of habits of responsible research and innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols.",
          "Puberty is a phase in which individuals often test the boundaries of themselves and surrounding others and further define their identity – and thus their uniqueness compared to other individuals. Similarly, as Computational Social Science (CSS) grows up, it must strike a balance between its own practices and those of neighboring disciplines to achieve scientific rigor and refine its identity. However, there are certain areas within CSS that are reluctant to adopt rigorous scientific practices from other fields, which can be observed through an overreliance on passively collected data (e.g., through digital traces, wearables) without questioning the validity of such data. This paper argues that CSS should embrace the potential of combining both passive and active measurement practices to capitalize on the strengths of each approach, including objectivity and psychological quality. Additionally, the paper suggests that CSS would benefit from integrating practices and knowledge from other established disciplines, such as measurement validation, theoretical embedding, and open science practices. Based on this argument, the paper provides ten recommendations for CSS to mature as an interdisciplinary field of research.",
          "Computational social science (CSS) is an evolving field with transformative potential to expose and address pressing societal challenges. Yet, because CSS, much like other scientific disciplines, operates within structural contexts addressing social bias remains a critical issue requiring attention in the field. Social bias, defined as the systematic discrimination and stereotyping of groups and individuals, relates to CSS in multiple ways. Drawing on literature, we critically examine these connections across three perspectives: understanding, detecting, and mitigating social bias. First, we provide a foundation for understanding how social bias shapes both CSS as a research field and its methodology. Second, we highlight how social bias can be detected not only within the CSS methodology itself but also through CSS applied to broader societal domains. Finally, moving forward, we propose strategies to mitigate social bias in the CSS methodology and CSS as a research field. With our contribution, we seek to demonstrate the breadth of ways in which social bias and CSS intersect and to chart paths toward a more equitable and robust CSS.",
          "The past 15 years have witnessed a remarkable increase in both the scale and scope of social and behavioral data available to researchers, leading some to herald the emergence of a new field: \"computational social science.\" Against these exciting developments stands a stubborn fact: that in spite of many thousands of published papers, there has been surprisingly little progress on the \"big\" questions that motivated the field in the first place?questions concerning systemic risk in financial systems, problem solving in complex organizations, and the dynamics of epidemics or social movements, among others. In this talk I highlight some examples of research that would not have been possible just a handful of years ago and that illustrate the promise of CSS. At the same time, they illustrate its limitations. I then conclude with some thoughts on how CSS can bridge the gap between its current state and its potential.",
          "Recently, relationships between law and science1 have witnessed the development of an area of great importance and interest represented by computational social science (hereinafter CSS), understood as “the integrated, interdisciplinary investigation of social systems as information-processing organizations and through the medium of advanced computational systems”2. Research methodologies that characterize contemporary science (statistics, mathematics and computation) have already played an important role in all social sciences, including an area, like the law, where this may seem less obvious. Just think, as a mere example, about the contribution statistics have made, and continue to make, in this field3. In this context, further research perspectives have been opened up by CSS. As pointed out by Cioffi-Revilla “computational social scientists are learning to exploit the advanced and increasingly powerful instruments of computation to see beyond the visible spectrum of more traditional disciplinary analyses”4, and it is interesting to look at (current or potential) applications for legal science of each of the five basic CSS research methods, namely automated information extraction, social network analysis, geospa-",
          "Two distinct factors are converging upon the current system of the MBA graduate degree. These two factors are an increasing complexity in computational systems embedded within traditional finance and business organizations and a broad democratization of computational tools serving the needs of computational social science. The global labor market of management increasingly needs graduates who understand how to strategically utilize these new tools of non-empirical research in order to solve emergent complex problems that traditional empirical research methods cannot handle. Drawing on the strength of similar programs, a distinct computational MBA degree appears imminent. It is not the future of the MBA and it is not a fundamentally different degree in its content. Nor is it a simple extension of the existing computational finance degree. Rather, it will be fundamentally different in its research and methodology, drawing on tools in computational social science to generate new methods of strategic analysis.",
          "I had the opportunity to present my work at CSS18 and CSS19 and was/am pleasantly surprised by its casual and stimulating ambience. The themes of this conference are highly aligned with interests of graduate students at our program. CSSA also hosts a sister conference Complexity and Policy Studies (CAPS) conference every year. Both these conferences might be ideal venues for our students to publish, and find collaborators and funding sources.\\nIn this talk, I present an overview of the CSS19 talks, categorize the conference presentations, highlight interesting talks, and align some of its recurring themes with our program's research areas. Based on my experience at the conference and my discussions with other collaborators, I argue that reframing systems science education around the buzzword computational social science more explicitly might help elicit more interest from students and the rest of the community. More importantly, the presence of this buzzword might help future graduating students find academic and industry jobs currently inaccessible because of obscurity surrounding the meaning of systems science.",
          "Bias is inescapable in the social world. Any one person has only a singular experience of life, and that experience becomes the lens through which they seek out, interact with, and interpret the world around them. Too often, bias grows insidious and malicious; enabling systems of oppression and reifying false evaluations as natural truth (Crenshaw, 2006; Jackson, Jr. &amp; Weidman, 2005). Given technology’s capacity to amplify bias (boyd &amp; Crawford, 2012; Buolamwini &amp; Gebru, 2018), we conduct a systematic review of communication literature in computational social science (CSS). Informed by this review, our primary contribution is the development of a conceptual framework to help researchers interrogate and mitigate bias across key stages of the research process. We argue that mitigating bias in CSS faces at least two interconnected challenges. The first is that science itself is social, and researchers are subject to the same biases we aim to mitigate. Each researcher is rooted in a paradigm that influences their ontological, epistemological, and axiological perspective, ultimately shaping what questions they ask, what data they use, and how they analyze and interpret their findings (Shugars, 2024a; Webb Williams, 2024). This may result in bias in what populations or issues are studied, such as the ongoing disparity of research tending to examine Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) societies (Henrich et al., 2010) or the reliance on Twitter as a model organism of social platform research (Tufekci, 2014). The impacts of such bias become even more insidious when coupled with the second challenge: empirical approaches—and computational methods in particular—may serve to reinforce and enhance existing biases (Buolamwini &amp; Gebru, 2018; D’Ignazio &amp; Klein, 2020; Shugars, 2024b). Indeed, modern statistics is built largely on the shoulders of eugenicists, whose practices of cranial measurements and IQ tests provided a numerical veneer of objectivity to their racist ideology (Jackson, Jr. &amp; Weidman, 2005). Critical scholars have long warned of the danger in interpreting subjective measurements as objective reality, arguing that our empiricist society is too quick to conflate numerical interpretations as natural truth. Unfortunately, there is reason to believe computational methods have only exacerbated this concern. Computational approaches often rely on large datasets of uncertain provenance, such as digital traces of online behavior (Lazer et al., 2021; Lazer &amp; Ognyanova, 2024). This data is typically passively generated as people use digital services to navigate their daily lives. While such ready-made data can provide valuable insights, researchers rarely have access to full knowledge of how such datasets were constructed or what biases they may reflect (Lazer &amp; Ognyanova, 2024; Salganik, 2019). Furthermore, the scale of such data typically requires standardization and reliance on algorithms, both of which can perpetuate existing inequalities. For example, the common preprocessing step of restricting a corpus to English-language text may disproportionately remove African American Vernacular English or other forms of speech deemed non-standard (Blodgett et al., 2016). Simultaneously, the use of black-box algorithms makes it challenging to determine whether and how bias is reflected in the resulting model (Shugars, 2024a). Finally, algorithmic output is reliant on human interpretation, which again raises the specter of human bias cloaked in the mantle of objective fact. Algorithmic-informed judgments are used in decisions about bail, insurance, and other life-changing matters, often with little thought to the bias baked in at every step of the process.

          "In The Urban Commons, Daniel O'Brien leverages the growing quantity of available data in order to reimagine the modern commons. The book serves simultaneously as a practical and theoretical guide to the nascent field of urban informatics. Through case studies reflecting the hands-on practicalities of his ideas, O'Brien situates this growing field within the broader commons literature. Specifically, O'Brien develops the concept of custodianship, and develops a division of labor model in which a range of civic actors play distinct roles in the ongoing maintenance of a commons. Integrating the theoretical and practical is a daunting task, but O'Brien manages to seamlessly these perspectives together throughout his book.Practically, The Urban Commons can be read as a how-to guide for city administrators, community organizations, or academics looking to leverage the ubiquity of large-scale urban data. O'Brien co-directs the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI), and in many respects, the book acts as a case study of a successful academic and community partnership. Through a particular focus on the City of Boston's 311 system, which citizens can use to report potholes, streetlamp outages, or to otherwise connect with nonemergency city services, O'Brien outlines the steps and constituents needed to turn such observational data into information that can meaningfully shape policy.While this practical dimension is valuable, the book's more significant contributions lie in its theoretical treatments of urban and civic studies. O'Brien argues that the modern availability of big data and computational methods opens new pathways not only for studying the “commons” in the traditional sense of shared resources, but in fundamentally reimagining what the commons are and why they are deserving of scholarly interest. This argument reflects the broad vision of computational social science (Lazer et al., 2009), which urges scholars to go beyond merely applying big data or new methods to traditional scholarly problems, and to instead use new tools and data to re-evaluate what questions we are able to ask.In other words, “urban informatics” should not be understood as merely the application of data or computational techniques to urban problems. While novel data and sensor technologies form the basis of the field, urban informatics can be more fully understood as a rich civic data infrastructure that enables both scientific pursuit and technocratic innovation around the physical and digital commons. O'Brien develops this argument in four parts over the course of his book. In the first two chapters, he discusses in detail how to think about and appropriately use administrative and other types of big data in an urban context. Second, he demonstrates how these techniques can be used to re-examine questions of the commons. Third, O'Brien delves into the role civic tech can play in partnerships and coproduction. Finally, he concludes with a thoughtful analysis of digital divides and inequity. It is a sweeping and bold vision, which lays important groundwork for reimaging commons research in the modern age.Chapter 1 introduces the field of urban informatics and lays the groundwork for considering the “introspective city.” Just as we might imagine ideal citizens as thoughtful, introspective individuals who continually learn and improve, O'Brien argues that we ought to aim for cities that go beyond being “smart” or “data-driven.” Rather, the collection and use of urban data should characterize a continual process of discovery and improvement; of introspection.In chapter 2, O'Brien grapples with the methodological challenges of such introspection. While there is an increasing amount of raw data available, these data are typically remnants of pre-established socio-technical processes. As Matthew Salganik (2017) would say, borrowing the language of the art world, these data are “readymade.” While the custom-made data of surveys or designed experiments allow researchers to pinpoint the exact constructs of interest, repurposing readymade data requires a thoughtful interrogation of the data-generating process. Understanding the bias and limitations of readymade data can be particularly challenging, since the researcher may not be aware of the specific decisions which led the data to be created.O'Brien demonstrates how to work with such data by showing how his team used public 311 records to develop and validate a measure of “custodianship.” The challenge, as with all readymade data, is that these records cannot be interpreted at face value. Does a greater number of 311 reports indicate a neighborhood with more physical disorder or a neighborhood with greater civic activity? Disambiguating these effects is nontrivial since a 311 record only exists if a person sees a problem, knows they can report that problem, and takes action to file a report. In a well-structured chapter that is accessible to those whose who prefer to skip over the technical details, O'Brien lays out the steps for assaying a construct and using readymade data to estimate, calibrate, and validate that construct.In chapter 3, O'Brien shows how this large-scale data can shed new insights into commons scholarship. Importantly, this goes beyond merely applying more data to an old problem, but more fundamentally interrogates the ways in which we conceive of traditional problems. Within the commons literature, we typically think of people as cooperators or free-riders, with cooperation driven by enlightened self-interest and maintained through clear group boundaries, sanctions, and other principles (Ostrom, 1994). Using Boston's 311 data, O'Brien shows that citizens who do the most reporting frequently do so in their own neighborhood. Furthermore, through a traditional survey, O'Brien finds that these custodians differ from non-custodians only in their sense of community, not through a desire for enforcing norms or increased property values. This suggests that citizens' care for their shared space can be best understood as an indicator of territoriality: individuals have an innate desire to care for the spaces to which they feel connected. The resulting collective benefit is incidental.This does not imply that traditional understandings of cooperation are invalid. But it does suggest that there may be other mechanisms at play, and the most salient factors may differ based on the specific commons under consideration.O'Brien continues this line of reasoning in chapter 4, arguing that the cooperator—free-rider model is often insufficient for questions relating to the urban commons. O'Brien instead suggests a more nuanced “division-of-labor” model in which individuals adopt distinctive patterns of custodianship. While there may be times when scholars want to understand the actions of individual people, O'Brien argues that a community's ability to maintain its commons is best understood at the collective, not individual, level.For example, O'Brien finds that denser neighborhoods tend to have fewer custodians per capita. This is consistent with a free-rider model and suggests that, on average, individuals in dense neighborhoods feel less personal responsibility. However, this finding provides no information on a neighborhood's ability to maintain its commons. Indeed, O'Brien further finds that dense neighborhoods have a higher coverage of custodianship—while each individual is less likely to act, there are more opportunities for someone to demonstrate the needed custodianship.While O'Brien demurs from extending this model beyond the urban commons, his reasoning has wide-ranging implications. Whether considering maintenance of a commons or civic life more generally, a “division of labor” model suggests that not all citizens need to be ideal at all things. If we think in terms of social justice, for example, we might imagine a commons where some citizens provide direct service to those in need while others work to address systemic disparities. No citizen does it all, and everyone “free-rides” in some sense of the word. But through this division of labor, the community works to address multiple issues at multiple levels.In chapters 5 and 6, O'Brien transitions to examining the role of “the public,” and experimenting with strategies for public-government coproduction. Specifically, O'Brien compares the public-as-citizen model to a public-as-partner model, arguing that we should think of custodianship not simply as an act of civic engagement, but more broadly as a partnership between the observational power of the public and the abilities of government to intervene.In a series of experiments, O'Brien finds that neighborhood messaging and report follow-up can increase the use of 311, but these strategies don't appear to significantly increase overall civic engagement. If we restrict ourselves to a public-as-citizen model, we might interpret these findings pessimistically. Under such a framework, we would hope that 311 systems and similar civic tech would serve as a gateway to thicker civic engagement. If they do not fulfill the function of increasing individuals' civic engagement, then they have arguably failed.A public-as-partner model, O'Brien argues, allows for a more generous interpretation and presents opportunities to rethink the dynamics of public-government coproduction. This is not to argue that increased civic engagement is not a laudable goal in its own right, merely that there may be times when “partnership” is an equally valuable goal. Coproduction systems, such as 311 platforms, hold the potential to leverage a range of motivations for a collective benefit. While we might hope they will lead to more civic engagement, their success or failure should not be tied to such an outcome.In many ways, this point reflects the “division of labor” argument put forth in chapter 4. It would be foolish to imagine all citizens as maximally engaged at all times. Building platforms and models which reach for such an unobtainable goal is counterproductive. Instead, we ought to think in terms of a diverse civic system, in which individuals operate with varying motivations, goals, and constraints. Civic practitioners should still seek to increase individual levels of civic engagement, but must also keep an eye toward the health of the overall civic system.Appropriately, O'Brien concludes in chapters 7 and 8 with an examination of disparities within the world of civic tech. In chapter 7, he discusses efforts to expand the 311 system to municipalities across the state of Massachusetts, and in chapter 8, he examines the challenges of digital literacy and access. Both chapters paint a mixed view of the current state of the civic data ecosystem. Some municipalities adapt well to the new civic tech, while others do not. O'Brien outlines some specific strategies for reducing this digital divide—namely training community organizations to serve as intermediaries in interpreting urban data. Yet, it is clear that more work needs to be done to ensure that all citizens and their communities are able to leverage emerging technology and their corresponding data.Missing from this account, however, is any concern about the potential power of the data-driven administrative state. That is, the normative framework of the book rests upon the assumption that the administrative ordering of the state is a fundamental good. O'Brien thoughtfully grapples with issues of inequity and data bias, but, in arguing that such issues can and should be corrected, he neglects to consider the potential for larger technocratic failures. In Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott warns that there is a danger in the collection and standardization of public data. This process isn't inherently bad per se, but it allows the state to define the terms of reality, to determine what counts, and to shape the bounds of public discourse. Such power is necessary to the functioning of the state, but it also holds the potential for great abuse if not wielded in democratic good faith. While O'Brien may feel these issues fall beyond the scope of The Urban Commons, as the field of urban informatics develops, it will need to grapple with these deeper concerns. Just as we may want to hold corporations accountable for how they use their vast troves of personal data, it is not prudent to assume that technocrats will always use the power of big data to act in the best interest of their citizens. Expanding the scope of The Urban Commons beyond a single city at a single point in time would require deep reflection on this fundamental concern of governing.Regardless, The Urban Commons presents an ambitious vision for the growing field of urban informatics. It is a field rooted equally in the big data approaches of informatics and the civic ideals of urban studies. Yet, in bringing these two fields together, “urban informatics” emerges as more than a computational approach to urban life. Through detailed case studies and examples of his own endeavors in the space, O'Brien illustrates how urban informatics can use big data and modern computational tools to fundamentally reimagine how we conceive of commons research. As always, there is more work to be done—there needs to be greater effort to decrease the digital divide and more thought given to the potential problems of an abusive state. Nevertheless, in The Urban Commons, O'Brien lays the groundwork for reimaging our understanding and approaches to the modern commons. This book may well be foundational for years to come as we rethink what it means to live collectively in the digital age.",
          "Nowadays, geographers and specialists in other disciplines perceive information and communication technologies, including GIS software, as part of the inevitable changes in practice and science (including geography). Recent ways of generating, processing, storing, analyzing and sharing data, creating and sharing texts, visualizing, mapping, analyzing, communicating ideas, video, podcasts, and presentations, sharing information, social networks and mainstream media are entirely dependent on computing technologies. Modern science in the digital age uses big data, artificial intelligence – machine learning methods (data mining, pattern recognition, geovisualization, spatial statistics, optimization and spatial simulation), which in turn have renewed interest in and ties with the fields of computational social sciences and data-driven geography, to gain deeper insights into quantitative, time-scale, multi-resolution and multi-scale research. The tool and product of a geographer’s research is, among other things, the map, a medium, a vehicle for geographic theories and ideas and a tool for conveying geo-information. However, the remediation of a traditional map into a digital map involves the transformation, addition, restriction or change of the meaning system of the original. The new digital medium arouses different attitudes, different emotions and triggers new practices of receiving geo-information among professionals and the public. Undoubtedly, this also applies to researchers–geographers who apply in their geospatial research multi-, inter- or transdisciplinary approaches based on different research paradigms. Integrated and problem-focused scientific discourse in geographic research and digital remediation of maps allow us to look at the future of (currently diversified) geographic research with some hope for its reintegration. The aim of the paper is to identify the possibilities, current and prospective paths and research topics of geography in Poland, which are interdisciplinary, combining the field of interest of physical, socio-economic geographers and specialists of space economy, using the modern instrumentarium of information and communication technologies in geography, i.e. geographic information systems.",
          "&lt;b&gt;Abstract.&lt;/b&gt; Decades of space policy research have yielded an eclectic, multidisciplinary research agenda replete with findings that are relevant for theory and policy. Absent from the literature, however, is a systematic review and discussion of the data and research methods used to ascertain these findings. This is important for research progress, because data and method choice have implications for the validity of the findings, potential contributions to theory, and efficacy of suggested policy prescriptions. Motivated by advances in computational social science, this article reviews the quantitative space policy literature and finds scope for further development with respect to data sources, method selection, and substantive topics of inquiry. Given these findings, two methodological areas are introduced, namely text and network analysis, and their utility is illustrated through an extension of a previous public opinion study, as well as a novel application regarding state support for international space law. This review might be relevant to scholars and practitioners interested in the empirical study of space policy.",
          "The article analyzes new approaches to forecasting international dynamics in the context of multipolarity and digitalization, focusing on interaction with the regions of the Global South. The research is aimed at overcoming the limitations of traditional methods through the integration of computing technologies into the analysis of complex political and economic processes. The central result is the development of information and analytical tools based on modern digital platforms. This toolkit allows one to operationalize key theoretical concepts such as the multidimensional presence of actors and the spatial determination of their decisions, providing an analysis of patterns of activity and influence in given regions. The use of artificial intelligence and geospatial analysis significantly expands the possibilities of processing large amounts of data, identifying hidden relationships and modeling scenarios. The work contributes to the development of computational social sciences by demonstrating the potential of technologically advanced, regionally oriented approaches for studying global interactions.",
          "Abstract Data on urban life are more accessible today than ever before. New sources of “big data” such as 311 requests, recorded police activity, digitized student records, and social media capture urban life on an unprecedented temporal and geographical scale. Combined with new and improved computational social science methods for harnessing data, they promise to change urban research in important ways. In this essay, we outline urban data science—an emerging, interdisciplinary approach to studying urban life using big data and computational social science methods. We discuss three key innovations that this approach offers for urban research: (i) a broader and more multifaceted definition of neighborhood activity, (ii) greater knowledge on the role of socio‐spatial interdependencies in urban life, and (iii) more dynamic understandings of urban issues and policies. We conclude by highlighting some challenges that urban scholars must collaboratively address as they engage in this new urban data science.",
          "Abstract This article re‐examines the history of the UK Centre for Environmental Studies (CES) between 1966 and 1975. Using archival materials and interviews, the article details the role of the CES in attempts to ‘modernize’ urban and regional research and working relationships between the academy and government. The CES is probably best known, by readers of this journal, as the initial editorial base for the International Journal of Urban and Regional Research ( IJURR ) and for its role in incubating radical urbanism. However, as we show, these activities sat alongside important early developments in both computational social science and radical experiments in the use of the social sciences in policymaking, in ways that have, hitherto, not been well understood. The article is not intended as an exercise in nostalgia but, rather, one that gestures towards what Mark Fisher termed a ‘hauntological’ form of analysis; to quote Fisher, ‘[w]hen the present has given up on the future’ there is value in listening ‘for the relics of the future in the unactivated potentials of the past’.",
          "Cities are essential crucibles for innovation, novelty, economic prosperity and diversity. They are not a mere reflection of individual characteristics, but instead the result of a complex interaction between people and space. Yet, little is known about this self-organized and complex relationship. Traditional approaches have either used surveys to explain in detail how a few individuals experience bits of a city, or considered cities as a whole from their outputs (e.g. total crimes). This tide has however tuned in recent years: the availability of new sources of data have allowed to observe, describe, and predict human behaviour in cities at an unprecedented scale and detail. This thesis adopts a \"data mining approach\" where we study urban spaces combining new sources of automatically collected data and novel statistical methods. Particularly, we focus on the relationship between the built environment, described by census information, geographical data, and images, and human behaviour proxied by extracted from mobile phone traces. The contribution of our thesis is two-fold. First, we present novel methods to describe urban vitality, by collecting and combining heterogeneous data sources. Second, we show that, by studying the built environment in conjunction with human behaviour, we can reliably estimate the effect of neighbourhood characteristics, predict housing prices and crime. Our results are relevant to researchers within a broad range of fields, from computer science to urban-planning and criminology, as well as to policymakers. The thesis is structured in two parts. In the first part, we investigate what creates urban life. We operationalize the theory of Jane Jacobs, one of the most famous authors in urban planning, who suggested that the built environment and vitality are intimately connected. Using Web and Open data to describe neighbourhoods, and mobile phone records to proxy urban vitality, we show that it is possible to predict vitality from the built environment, thus confirming Jacob's theory. Also, we investigate the effect of safety perception on urban vitality by introducing a novel Deep Learning model that relies on street-view images to extract security perception. Our model describes how perception modulates the relative presence of females, elderly and younger people in urban spaces. Altogether, we demonstrate how objective and subjective characteristics describe urban life. In the second part of this dissertation, we outline two studies that stress the importance of considering, at the same time, multiple factors to describe cities. First, we build a predictive model showing that objective and subjective neighbourhood features drive more than 20% of the housing price. Second, we describe the effect played by a neighbourhood's characteristics on the presence of crime. We present a Bayesian method to compare two alternative criminology theory, and show that the best description is achieved by considering together socio-economic characteristics, built-environment, and mobility of people. Also, we highlight the limitations of transferring what we learn from one city to another. Our findings show that new sources of data, automatically sensed from the environment, can complement the lengthy and costly survey-based collection of urban data and reliably describe neighbourhoods at an unprecedented scale and breath. We anticipate that our results will be of interest to researchers in computer science, urban planning, sociology and more broadly, computational social science.",
          "ABSTRACT Happiness traditionally attributed to wealth, health and social relationships has been observed to be influenced by peoples' dwelling locations. It has also been found that people are happier even when they tour around or traverse in cities and places by choosing paths that are emotionally pleasing, and appealing to the senses. This has been the theme of the paper titled The Shortest Path to Happiness: Recommending Beautiful, Quiet and Happy Routes in the City by Quercia, Schifanella and Aiello. The paper is considered a masterpiece in computational social science, particularly in psycho-geography. The goal of the paper is to suggest to people, traversing in cities, routes that are not only short by distance but also make them happy and emotionally comfortable. The authors use data from crowd-sourcing platforms and user votes to decide which routes look more beautiful, quiet, and happy during journeys. The remainder of this document presents the summary and critique of the paper and offers future options for a research paper in computational social science. Keywords path, happiness, city-critique",
          "The global surge in social inequalities is one of the most pressing issues of our times. The spatial expression of social inequalities at city scale gives rise to urban segregation, a common phenomenon across different local and cultural contexts. The increasing popularity of Big Data and computational models has inspired a growing number of computational social science studies that analyze, evaluate, and issue policy recommendations for urban segregation. Today's wealth in information and computational power could inform urban planning for equity. However, as we show here, segregation research is epistemologically interdependent with prevalent economic theories which overfocus on individual responsibility while neglecting systemic processes. This individualistic bias is also engrained in computational models of urban segregation. Through several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the assumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and policies, our essay tells a cautionary tale. We highlight how a lack of consideration for data ethics can lead to the creation of computational models that have a real-life, further marginalizing impact on disadvantaged groups. With this essay, our aim is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls and potentials of computational approaches to urban segregation, thereby fostering a conscious focus on systemic thinking about urban inequalities. We suggest setting an agenda for research and collective action that is directed at demobilizing individualistic bias, informing our thinking about urban segregation, but also more broadly our efforts to create sustainable cities and communities.",
          "Using multilayered individual massive data and geo-localization tracking, Computational Social Science and Social Physics attest the importance of face-to-face and place-to-place interactions in shaping human agency. The research suggests that collective and individual behaviors can be described by the “social bridges” that bind local communities in daily activities. By looking at various metropolitan regions across the world, findings point to the resilience of social bridges in predicting economic, political and health-related characteristics of local populations. Communities that share similar practices of metropolitan spaces also express similarities in those behaviors. Such results are akin to theories of urbanism that promote the importance of spatial configurations in describing markets, power and well-being. With this paper, I wish to look at the empirical findings of Computational Social Sciences and Social Physics through the lens of those theories, and propose a general understanding of human agency based on aspirations, affordances and capabilities. Instead of competing with previous approaches, the view that individuals act in accordance to their environment as an extension of their desires and aptitudes provides a long-waited hinge to bind Social Physics and previous theoretical models. In a second step, I discuss how such model can afford tools to architects, planners and policy-makers to increase collaboration and cooperation between local communities and decrease the economic and political polarization of contemporary metropolitan spaces.",
          "Social media (such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook) are powerful computer‐supported social networks for idea exchange and personal networking. Most social media messages contain spatial information in the form of geotags, user profiles, or place names in the messages, which can be used to create spatial social networks. Spatial social networks transform social networks into maps and information landscapes using real‐world locations or abstract coordinate systems. After the transformation, scientists can conduct space–time analyses, understand the diffusion of information, and identify spatial cluster patterns of network elements. Scientists now can trace, monitor, and analyze the dynamic change of social networks and social communications from a perspective of spatiotemporal analysis. These research efforts can help us understand the characteristics of innovation diffusion, enable the discovery of knowledge in cyberspace, and facilitate the emergence of a data‐driven computational social science.",
          "Traditional classifications of global development, such as the developed/developing dichotomy or Global North/South, often oversimplify the intricate landscape of human development. This paper leverages computational tools, advanced visualization techniques, and mathematical modeling to challenge these conventional categories and reveal a continuous development spectrum among nations. By applying hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling, and interactive visualizations to Human Development Index (HDI) data, we identify “development neighborhoods”—clusters of countries that exhibit similar development patterns, sometimes across geographical boundaries. Our methodology combines network theory, statistical physics, and digital humanities approaches to model development as a continuous field, introducing novel metrics for development potential and regional inequality. Through analysis of HDI data from 193 countries (1990–2022), we demonstrate significant regional variations in development trajectories, with Africa showing the highest mean change rate (28.36%) despite maintaining the lowest mean HDI (0.557). The implementation of circle packing and radial dendrogram visualizations reveals both population dynamics and development continuums, while our mathematical framework provides rigorous quantification of development distances and cluster stability. This approach not only uncovers sophisticated developmental progressions but also emphasizes the importance of continuous frameworks over categorical divisions. The findings highlight how digital humanities tools can enhance our understanding of global development, providing policymakers with insights that traditional methods might overlook. Our methodology demonstrates the potential of computational social science to offer more granular analyses of development, supporting policies that recognize the diversity within regional and developmental clusters, while our mathematical framework provides a foundation for future quantitative studies in development economics.",
          "This dissertation examines how neighborhood context shapes interethnic group relations. The current empirical evidence on the intergroup relations-neighborhood nexus reveals two central research gaps that guide this work. First, there is a need to expand the range of available neighborhood context indicators. Second, there is a need to move beyond coarse administrative geographies as approximations of neighborhood context toward smaller-scale, more individualized approximations of neighborhood context that may better capture local dynamics. To address these gaps, this dissertation employs an innovative methodological approach. It augments georeferenced survey data from Belgian National Election Study 2020 with big geodata sources and applies computational social science methods (i.e., supervised machine learning and GIS algorithms). This dissertation draws on several big geodata sources. The primary dataset is OpenStreetMap, which forms the central focus of the dissertation. Additional datasets include georeferenced survey data, geotagged Twitter/X data, and Google Maps data. To address the first gap, the dissertation focuses on novel, big geodata-based built environment neighborhood indicators of neighborhood context, such as spaces of encounter (e.g., parks, schools, cafés) and Islamic points of interest, together with more established administrative indicators, such as ethnic diversity and socioeconomic status. To address the second gap, the dissertation employs both small-scale administrative geographical units and custom-made GIS-based geographical units, such as walking- and driving-time neighborhood contexts as approximations of immediate neighborhood context. First, the findings show while novel built environment indicators enrich understanding of neighborhood contexts for intergroup relations, they complement rather than replace established contextual indicators, such as socioeconomic and ethnic diversity. Likewise, by augmenting georeferenced survey data from Belgian National Election Study 2020 with GIS-based walking- and driving-time neighborhood approximations, the results demonstrate that the relationship between neighborhood indicators and intergroup outcomes depends on how neighborhood context is approximated and measured. Second, the dissertation also demonstrates how big geodata from OpenStreetMap, as a central data source, can enrich survey data contextually and enable the inclusion of geocontextual variables that were previously inaccessible or complicated to capture. It provides a methodological guide on how to use OpenStreetMap for survey data augmentation. Overall, the dissertation highlights that neighborhoods are multidimensional contexts and should be treated as such. Similarly, it demonstrates the methodological value of augmenting survey data with big geodata and the use of computational methods. It offers concrete use-cases for both neighborhood context indicator operationalization and neighborhood context approximation.",
          "Thanks to the use of geolocated big data in computational social science research, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of human activities is increasingly being revealed. Paired with smaller and more traditional data, this opens new ways of understanding how people act and move, and how these movements crystallise into the structural patterns observed by censuses. In this article we explore the convergence between mobile phone data and more traditional socioeconomic data from the national census in French cities. We extract mobile phone indicators from six months worth of Call Detail Records (CDR) data, while census and administrative data are used to characterize the socioeconomic organisation of French cities. We address various definitions of cities and investigate how they impact the statistical relationships between mobile phone indicators, such as the number of calls or the entropy of visited cell towers, and measures of economic organisation based on census data, such as the level of deprivation, inequality and segregation. Our findings show that some mobile phone indicators relate significantly with different socioeconomic organisation of cities. However, we show that relations are sensitive to the way cities are defined and delineated. In several cases, changing the city delineation rule can change the significance and even the sign of the correlation. In general, cities delineated in a restricted way (central cores only) exhibit traces of human activity which are less related to their socioeconomic organisation than cities delineated as metropolitan areas and dispersed urban regions.",
          "A restless intellectual dynamic has been witnessed in the field of data-driven social science in the past two decades, especially where computational social science meets GIS (geographic information science). Emerging theoretical viewpoints, data sources, and methodological advances have offered novel venues to examine both spatial and semantic information in high-dimensional and heterogeneous social datasets. Space and place can integrate social science disciplines both theoretically and methodologically. A recent surge of interests in computational social science research has been witnessed due to the increasingly availability of fine-scale human behavior and social network data. GIS-based computational social science thus emphasizes the spatio-temporal social relationships and movements ranging from micro- (individual) to macro- (social group or administrative unit) perspectives. This entry opens with GIS and Computational Social Science: History and Status and the frameworks on which it is based. We have identified three interrelated themes and one trend: (1) Spatial Regression and Simulation, (2) Spatial Social Networking, (3) Human Mobility, and (4) integrated conceptualizations, analytical methods, and open source packages toward synthesis and convergence. The convergence between GIS and Computational Social Science can be achieved through these human-centered and context-based interrelated themes. With the increasingly available detailed individual-level data and analytical tools, the cross-fertilisationbetween GIS and computational social science brings the human factor to the former while situating the latter in the spatial context. Finally, the implications of such trends in terms of achieving convergence and synthesis between GIS and computational social science are presented.",
          "Abstract As the volume of digital data is growing exponentially and computational methods are advancing rapidly, network analysis is an increasingly important analytical tool to understand social life. This paper revisits the rich history of network analysis in geography and uses insights from that history to review contemporary computational social science. Based on that analysis, we synthesize the distinctive qualities of what we term geographical network analysis. Geographical network analysis presumes that networks are situated, construed through meaning, and reflect power relations. Instead of pursuing parsimonious explanations or universal theories, geographical network analysis strives to understand how uneven networks develop across space and within place through a constant back and forth between abstraction and contextualization. Drawing on the articles in this special issue, this paper illustrates how geographical network analysis can be put to work.",
          "Empirical studies of ancient cities must break down communities into their component parts, but frequently encounter difficulty with the scarcity of excavated domestic structures (e.g., Kramer, 1982, p. 673). I introduce to the archaeological literature the entropy estimating statistical bootstrap (EESB), a tool developed in information theory and computational social science by DeDeo et al. (2013) which provides a way to assess how representative a small dataset is of a parent population, categorized according to some useful typology. This method can be used to decide when small datasets can add further detail to our quantitative studies of archaeological settlements or when they need to be rejected as too small. I then illustrate its uses within the context of urban demography by examining the distribution of house forms to calculate household characteristics specific to Metapontum, an ancient Greek city. Future applications will include building larger urban datasets that are empirically grounded in the specific evidence for each community, facilitating the work of research programs such as urban scaling.",
          "To identify cluster of societies is not easy in subject to the availability of data. In this study, from the prospective of computational social science, we propose a novel method to cluster Chinese regional cultures. Using millions of geotagged online-gaming data of Chinese internet users playing online card and board games with regional features, 336 Chinese cities are grouped into several main clusters. The geographic boundaries of clusters coincide with the boundaries of provincial regions. The north regions in China have more geographical proximity, when regional variations in south regions are more evident."

          "Adoption of social media has experienced explosive growth in recent years, and this trend appears likely to continue. A natural consequence has been the creation of vast quantities of data being generated by social media applications, and hence increased interest from the database community. This data is also providing unique opportunities to understand the sociological and psychological aspects, human interaction, and media production/consumption, and hence the growth in areas such as user modeling, behavior analysis, and social network analysis, which together is being labeled as the emerging area of Computational Social Science (CSS) [37, 59]. These new types of data analysis are leading to the introduction of new computational techniques, e.g. p* modeling, ERGMs [62], co-clustering [6], etc. This paper focuses on a scalable implementation of Bregman co-clustering algorithm and its application to social media analysis. Bregman co-clustering algorithm performs two-way clustering and is theoretically scalable while we discuss an OLAP based implementation to achieve this goal. Principally, we demonstrate how aggregations required by the algorithm can be mapped naturally to summary statistics computed by an OLAP engine and stored in data cubes. Our OLAP based implementation of the algorithm is able to handle large-scale datasets, i.e. datasets that are too large for main memory based implementations. Further, we explore the suitability of the relational model for modeling social media data. Specifically, we argue that data cubes and the star schema are well suited for managing social media data. Our research is a step toward the increasing interest the research community has in connecting three research areas, namely database, data mining, and social media analysis.",

          "Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce Digital Methods Initiative Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset, a toolset for capturing and analyzing Twitter data. Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach – The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings – The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications – Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value – The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities.",
          "This paper is written for (social science) researchers seeking to analyze the wealth of social media now available. It presents a comprehensive review of software tools for social networking media, wikis, really simple syndication feeds, blogs, newsgroups, chat and news feeds. For completeness, it also includes introductions to social media scraping, storage, data cleaning and sentiment analysis. Although principally a review, the paper also provides a methodology and a critique of social media tools. Analyzing social media, in particular Twitter feeds for sentiment analysis, has become a major research and business activity due to the availability of web-based application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by Twitter, Facebook and News services. This has led to an ‘explosion’ of data services, software tools for scraping and analysis and social media analytics platforms. It is also a research area undergoing rapid change and evolution due to commercial pressures and the potential for using social media data for computational (social science) research. Using a simple taxonomy, this paper provides a review of leading software tools and how to use them to scrape, cleanse and analyze the spectrum of social media. In addition, it discussed the requirement of an experimental computational environment for social media research and presents as an illustration the system architecture of a social media (analytics) platform built by University College London. The principal contribution of this paper is to provide an overview (including code fragments) for scientists seeking to utilize social media scraping and analytics either in their research or business. The data retrieval techniques that are presented in this paper are valid at the time of writing this paper (June 2014), but they are subject to change since social media data scraping APIs are rapidly changing.",

          "Social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter provide an unprecedented amount of qualitative data about organizations and collective behavior. Yet these new data sources lack critical information about the broader social context of collective behaviorâ€”or protect it behind strict privacy barriers.

          "The CMAP (cultural mapping and pattern analysis) visualization toolkit introduced in this paper is an open-source suite for analyzing and visualizing text data—from qualitative fieldnotes and in-depth interview transcripts to historical documents and web-scaped data like message board posts or blogs. The toolkit is designed for scholars integrating pattern analysis, data visualization, and explanation in qualitative and/or computational social science (CSS). Despite the existence of off-the-shelf commercial qualitative data analysis software, there is a dearth of highly scalable open source options that can work with large data sets, and allow advanced statistical and language modeling.

          "The discovery of phenomena in social networks has prompted renewed interests in the field. Data in social networks however can be massive, requiring scalable Big Data architecture. Conversely, research in Big Data needs the volume and velocity of social media data for testing its scalability. Not only so, appropriate data processing and mining of acquired datasets involve complex issues in the variety, veracity, and variability of the data, after which visualisation must occur before we can see fruition in our efforts. This article presents topical, multimodal, and longitudinal social media datasets from the integration of various scalable open source technologies. The article details the process that led to the discovery of social information landscapes within the Twitter social network, highlighting the experience of dealing with social media datasets, using a funneling approach so that data becomes manageable. The article demonstrated the feasibility and value of using scalable open source technologies for acquiring massive, connected datasets for research in the social sciences."

          "Digitally-aided reviews of large bodies of text-based information, such as academic literature, are growing in capability but are not yet common in environmental fields. Environmental sciences and studies can benefit from application of digital tools to create comprehensive, replicable, interdisciplinary reviews that provide rapid, up-to-date, and policy-relevant reports of existing work. This work reviews the potential for applications of computational text mining and analysis tools originating in the humanities to environmental science and policy questions. Two process-oriented case studies of digitally-aided environmental literature reviews and meta-analyses illustrate potential benefits and limitations. A medium-sized, medium-resolution review (∼8000 journal abstracts and titles) focuses on topic modeling as a rapid way to identify thematic changes over time. A small, high-resolution review (∼300 full text journal articles) combines collocation and network analysis with manual coding to synthesize and question empirical field work. We note that even small digitally-aided analyses are close to the upper limit of what can be done manually. Established computational methods developed in humanities disciplines and refined by humanities and social science scholars to interrogate large bodies of textual data are applicable and useful in environmental sciences but have not yet been widely applied. Two case studies provide evidence that digital tools can enhance insight. Two major conclusions emerge. First, digital tools enable scholars to engage large literatures rapidly and, in some cases, more comprehensively than is possible manually. Digital tools can confirm manually identified patterns or identify additional patterns visible only at a large scale. Second, digital tools allow for more replicable and transparent conclusions to be drawn from literature reviews and meta-analyses. The methodological subfields of digital humanities and computational social sciences will likely continue to create innovative tools for analyzing large bodies of text, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration with the environmental fields.",
          "Using empirical methods from NLP has led to tremendous progress in the social sciences and humanities. I address how leveraging innovative NLP techniques has helped to discover and validate hypotheses about the functioning and patterns of complex societal systems, jointly considering the content and structure of social and socio-technical interactions, and scaling up the analysis of human-centered, qualitative, and multi-modal data. Knowledge from the social sciences has in turn informed and advanced data annotation, model building, and result explanation in NLP. At the same time, the choices we make when studying and predicting the structure and behavior of groups matter. I discuss how differences in research design, epistemology, and culturally contextualized algorithms impact knowledge discovery, theory development, practical applications, and policies. I conclude with implications of work at the nexus of NLP and the social sciences on innovation, validation, and bridging differences in scales.",
          "Computational social science, as an emerging interdisciplinary discipline, is a field ushered in by long‐term development of traditional social science. It is committed to supplying data thinking, resources, and analytics to study human social behavior and social operation laws to accurately grasp and judge the developing path of the discipline, which is of great significance to promote the innovation and development of social sciences. This study is to conduct a systematic quantitative analysis from a bibliometric perspective, aiming to provide a reference for scholars to explore the paths and changing rules in the field. We use the relevant literature in Web of Science as the dataset. After eliminating journal calls and irrelevant literature, R language and SciMAT tools are used to visualize and analyze the number of articles, keyword clustering, keyword cooccurrence network, and theme evolution, so as to summarize and sort out the paths of computational social science research. The study found that the annual volume of publications has been gradually increasing and will probably remain active in the next few years with high productivity. Subject themes in different periods are diversified, and the evolutionary relationship is found complex as well. Besides, as a cross discipline, scientific knowledge from different fields cross collides and couples with each other in the big data environment, changing the traditional concept of computational social science and forming a new development path. Recently, the emergence of “big data+” has promoted the rise of new subject areas, making the development of new disciplines a reality.",

          "Abstract In this poster we describe a pilot study of searching social science literature for legacy corpora to evaluate text mining algorithms. The new emerging field of computational social science demands large amount of social science data to train and evaluate computational models. We argue that the legacy corpora that were annotated by social science researchers through traditional Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) are ideal data sets to evaluate text mining methods, such as text categorization and clustering. As a pilot study, we searched articles that involve content analysis and discourse analysis in leading communication journals, and then contacted the authors regarding the availability of the annotated texts. Regretfully, nearly all of the corpora that we found were not adequately maintained, and many were no longer available, even though they were less than ten years old. This situation calls for more effort to better maintain and use legacy social science data for future computational social science research purpose.",

Surveying 433 international scholars who published text-based research in top social science journals from 2016 to 2020, we assess concerns about CTAM validity, validation strategies, and challenges with multilingual corpora. Our analysis shows that multilingual scholars have more concerns about CTAM validity but do not use stricter validation methods. Additionally, non-native English speakers are more likely to analyze English texts with CTAM. These findings highlight an English-language bias in computational tools, suggesting a need for a more inclusive, multilingual approach in computational social science.",
          "With the rising popularity of interdisciplinary work and increasing institutional incentives in this direction, there is a growing need to understand how resulting publications incorporate ideas from multiple disciplines. Existing computational approaches, such as affiliation diversity, keywords, and citation patterns, do not account for how individual citations are used to advance the citing work. Although, in line with addressing this gap, prior studies have proposed taxonomies to classify citation purpose, these frameworks are not well-suited to interdisciplinary research and do not provide quantitative measures of citation engagement quality. To address these limitations, we propose a framework for the evaluation of citation engagement in interdisciplinary Natural Language Processing (NLP) publications. Our approach introduces a citation purpose taxonomy tailored to interdisciplinary work, supported by an annotation study. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through a thorough analysis of publications at the intersection of NLP and Computational Social Science.",
          "<strong>Objective.</strong> This poster intends to offer a socio-semantic overall view of the research domain on <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> as a major quarantine pest with worldwide expansion. This scientometric analysis is applied on a corpus of bibliographic notices, which has been delineated in the Web of Science database with a query based on the reference to <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> bacteria as a matter of scientific enquiry and as models for phytopathology. Analysis are conducted thanks to the CorTexT Platform, an open science capacity to run various type of textual and network analysis which belong to the RISIS European Infrastructure for science and innovation policies (https://www.risis2.eu/). The purpose of this analysis is to deliver to researchers and policy-maker a retrospective account of the constitution and development of the research domain on <em>Xylella fastidiosa. </em>This account is based on the complementary visions and knowledge of authors’ discipline: computational social science, phytopathology, ecology and genomics. <strong>Methodology. </strong>Based on the co-word analysis tradition in Scientometrics (Callon et al., 1983; Waltman, Noyons et al., 2010) and advanced methods in quantitative sciences studies (Cambrosio et al., 2020) our quali-quantitative approach of scientific literature is based on some already well-documented methods of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks analysis and their visualization with Louvain clustering algorithm. We mobilize the portfolio of scripts and algorithms that are proposed on the open platform CorTexT (Barbier &amp; Cointet, 2021). Harnessing a methodology already elaborated in a previous research about ecosystem services (Tancoigne et al., 2014) or Nanotechnology (Kahane et al. 2015) or synthetic biology (Raimbault et al., 2016), we establish the structural composition of this particular research domain with clustering methodology. <strong>Results.</strong> A common analysis of fields like co-authors, keywords and cited-reference networks deliver a global and structural account of the domain a first layer of descriptive results. Then, using the projection of a third variable (authors’ countries; journals) with a contingency matrix analysis, we show the existence of national research engagements and almost geopolitics of <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> research, because of historical investments of scientific activities on the main plant diseases induced by this bacterium. A third result is produced while using bibliographic coupling to cluster the results of a terminological extraction of abstracts; we establish the socio-epistemic features of the domain, and the disciplinary or interdisciplinary lineaments of its composition. This approach enables to deepen the understanding of the research domain despite its polarities on wine grapes, citrus and olive tree. Finally, thanks to evolutionary approach of clustering extracted N-Grams (Chavalarias &amp; Cointet, 2013) we characterised the scientific dynamic of xyl. fastidiosa research domain in the long run. <strong>Conclusion. </strong>Our analysis establishes the continuous polarization of scientific exploration through time but also the latest scientific achievements, corresponding to new issues, and the late outbreak in Puglia. This perspective enables to identify the European specificity that is emerging with previous outbreaks. <strong>References</strong> Barbier, M.; Cointet, J.P., (2012).

          "<title>Abstract</title> Prior analyses and assessments of the impact of scientific research has mainly relied on analyzing its scope within academia and its influence within scholarly circles. However, by not considering the broader societal, economic, and policy implications of research projects, these studies overlook the ways in which scientific discoveries contribute to technological innovation, public health improvements, environmental sustainability, and other areas of real-world application. We expand upon this prior work by developing and validating a conceptual and computational solution to automatically identify and categorize the impact of scientific research within and especially beyond academia based on text data. We first empirically develop and evaluate an annotation schema to capture and classify the impact of research projects based on research reports from different scientific domains. We then annotate a large dataset of more than 45k sentences extracted from research reports for the developed impact categories. We examine the annotated dataset for patterns in the distribution of impact categories across different scientific domains, co-occurrences of impact categories, and signal words of impact. Using the annotated texts and the novel classification schema, we investigate the performance of large language models (LLMs) for automated impact classification. Our results show that fine-tuning the models on our annotated datasets statistically significantly outperforms zero- and fewshot prompting approaches. This indicates that state-of-the-art LLMs without fine-tuning may not work well for novel classification schemas such as our impact classification schema, and in turn highlights the importance of diligent manual annotations as empirical basis in the field of computational social science.",
          "Advancing health equity requires rigorous analysis of how research initiatives incorporate and address structural disparities across populations. In this study, we apply large language models (LLMs) to systematically analyze research projects registered on the All of Us platform, with a focus on identifying patterns and institutional dynamics associated with health equity research. We examine the relationship between projects that explicitly pursue health equity goals and their use of available demographic data, their institutional composition (e.g., single- vs. multi-institutional teams), and the research tier of participating institutions (R1 vs. R2). Using the capabilities of an established LLM, we automate key tasks including the extraction of relevant attributes from unstructured project descriptions, classification of institutional affiliations, and the summarization of project content into standardized keywords from the Unified Medical Language System vocabulary. This LLM-assisted pipeline enabled scalable, replicable analysis of hundreds of projects with minimal manual overhead. Our findings suggest a strong association between the use of demographic data and health equity aims, and indicate nuanced differences in equity-oriented research participation by institution type and collaborative structure. More broadly, our approach demonstrates how LLMs can support equity-focused computational social science by transforming free-text administrative data into analyzable structures, enabling novel insights in public health, team science, and science-of-science studies.",

          "The use of computational methods for text analysis has been rapidly gaining a foothold in computational social science. Yet, little is known about the reporting practices of the software tools utilised in this field.

To this end, we reviewed 406 journal articles, representing all computational text analysis articles published in top social science journals between 2016 and 2020, and identified all software tools reported. We explore both article-level and tool-level characteristics and investigate their association with the mentioning of software tools. Our findings indicate a consistent pattern of tool reporting across time and disciplines, while authors who detail methodological validation within their papers are more inclined to mention the software tools employed. Furthermore, we observe that software tools with greater accessibility tend to receive more frequent mentions, while the maintenance status of the tools does not significantly impact their frequency of being mentioned. We discuss the implications of these results for the further development of computational text analysis in social science and especially communication research.",

          "We identify three gaps that limit the utility and obstruct the progress of computational text analysis methods (CTAM) for social science research. First, we contend that CTAM development has prioritized technological over validity concerns, giving limited attention to the operationalization of social scientific measurements. Second, we identify a mismatch between CTAMs’ focus on extracting specific contents and document-level patterns, and social science researchers’ need for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text. Third, we argue that the dominance of English language tools depresses comparative research and inclusivity toward scholarly communities examining languages other than English. We substantiate our claims by drawing upon a broad review of methodological work in the computational social sciences, as well as an inventory of leading research publications using quantitative textual analysis. Subsequently, we discuss implications of these three gaps for social scientists’ uneven uptake of CTAM, as well as the field of computational social science text research as a whole. Finally, we propose a research agenda intended to bridge the identified gaps and improve the validity, utility, and inclusiveness of CTAM."

          "This thesis explores social dilemmas in science and collective cognition more generally, using high-energy physics as a primary example. Through multiple computational case-studies, it examines how scientists in this field navigate dilemmas related to specialization, adaptation, cooperation, and coordination. The core contribution of this research is the development of an \"adaptive multi-agent system'' framework for understanding and modelling collective cognition at large. This framework integrates concepts from social epistemology, game theory, and cognitive and complexity sciences in order to investigate how rationally bounded agents, operating within structured social networks, resolve social dilemmas arising in scientific contexts. Three central tenets guide this approach: (1) collective cognition gives rise to emergent social dilemmas with significant epistemic implications, (2) understanding these dilemmas requires a computational framework drawing from a wide range of disciplines, and (3) to better understand collective cognition, we need computational approaches that are both formal and empirical.Three case studies in high-energy physics illustrate different aspects of the framework. The first study examines the growing divide between phenomenologists and theorists, particularly in relation to the theory of supersymmetry. The second analyzes how physicists collectively balance specialization and adaptation in a changing scientific landscape, using Inverse Optimal Transport to assess how cognitive costs shape research trajectories. The final case study investigates the trade-offs and dilemmas involved in the diffusion of scientific conventions by applying a novel statistical physics approach to a sign convention in physics.This thesis offers new perspectives for the philosophy of science, the sociology of science, and computational social science. First, it shows how the notion of collective cognition offers new insights on longstanding issues such as scientific underdetermination and the relation between the cognitive and the social in science. In addition, this thesis contributes to fill a gap between qualitative and quantitative social studies of science, through novel implementations of qualitative insights into quantitative analyses, and by demonstrating the potential of computational models to assist the formation of new philosophical or sociological concepts. Finally, this thesis shows how inverse problems can bridge otherwise disconnected formal and empirical traditions in computational social science. It also suggests that recurrent patterns of self-organization in socio-cognitive systems could be understood functionally as solutions to social dilemmas, opening up new research opportunities in the science of complex systems.",
          "the same people interact frequently, they come to think alike, a phenomenon we call collective cognitive (C 3 ). We discuss instances and practical consequences of this phenomenon; review previous work in sociology, computational social science, and evolutionary biology that sheds light on C 3 ; define a computational model and metrics for the convergence process; report on experiments with this model and metrics; and suggest how insights from the model can help manage C 3 .",
          "Explaining how properties at the level of individuals translate into properties at the level of collectives is a core objective of sociology. Because the social world is characterized by complex webs of social interdependencies, establishing how micro and macro are related to one another requires a detailed understanding of how individuals are influenced by their social environments and the consequences that such influences have for the dynamics of the social process. However, until very recently, it has been difficult to conduct detailed empirical investigations of micro-macro linkages due to the lack of large-scale data containing information on how individuals interact with one another. In the absence of such data, substantive research has tended to (a) focus its attention elsewhere: studying how social factors influence individual outcomes, rather than how actors in interaction with one another bring about collective outcomes, or (b) propose models of micro-macro linkages that—for reasons of parsimony and tractability—often assume artificially high levels of homogeneity. Against this background, this thesis sets out to investigate, first, how the data and tools that have emerged from the digital and computational revolution can help sociologists construct empirically well-founded mappings from the micro to the macro level, and second, how the conclusions about the role of social interdependencies and networks change when the analysis is informed by real-world heterogeneities. In the introductory chapter, a conceptual and analytical framework for studying micro-macro processes is proposed that integrates the theoretical principles of analytical sociology with the data and methods of computational social science. This framework constitutes the foundation of the thesis. It is used in Essays I-III, and it is methodologically built upon in Essay IV. In Essay I, the role of social networks in labor-market segregation processes is examined. Scholarship on labor-market segregation commonly assume that social networks have a segregating effect because of homophilous selection tendencies in network-based recruitment. Using large-scale register data and focusing attention on individuals’ heterogenous opportunities to form same-category ties in different workplaces, Essay I finds that opportunity structures often dominate homophilic preferences. In particular, a mechanism is identified which shows—in contradiction with the main tenet of previous research—that networks often reduce rather than increase segregation by triggering mobility events that counteract the impact of segregating mobility events. Essay II examines the conditions under which social influence can decouple adoption behaviour from individual preferences and thereby bring about unexpected collective outcomes. Prior research has shown that such decoupling can occur, but conflicting evidence and implicit assumptions of strong homogeneity mean that we still know little about the conditions under which this is likely to occur in the real world. Addressing these limitations, this study uses fine-grained, real-world behavioural data from Spotify to estimate heterogeneous social influence effects conditional on properties of individuals’ social environments, and then examine their macro-implications in empirically calibrated simulations. It is found that partial overlap in preferences and strong social ties between the senders and receivers of social influence is needed for social influence to produce decoupling. Essay III centers on the phenomenon of urban scaling and examines the relationship between within-city and between-city inequality. Previous urban scaling research has documented how cities’ total outputs increase more than proportionally with city size and has proposed theoretical models which demonstrate impressive predictive accuracy at aggregate levels. However, this research has overlooked the stark inequalities that exist within cities. Using microdata from multiple countries, it is found that between 36–80% of the previously reported scaling effects can be explained by differences in the distributional tails of cities. Providing explanatory depth to these findings, a cumulative advantage mechanism is identified which elucidates one important channel through which differences in the size of cities’ tails emerge. In Essay IV, a method is proposed for inferring theoretically meaningful dimensions from complex high-dimensional data such as text. The results show that the method captures latent semantic concepts better than or on-par with the current state of the art. For the study of social interactions, the method constitutes a new and potentially important tool for inferring theoretically meaningful dimensions about individuals and their social environments, and in so doing, improves our ability to adjust for specific types of homophily and enables richer and more precise measures of heterogeneity in social interaction processes.",
          "The computational modeling of groups requires models that connect micro-level with macro-level processes and outcomes. Recent research in computational social science has started from simple models of human behaviour, and attempted to link to social structures. However, these models make simplifying assumptions about human understanding of culture that are of ten not realistic and may be limiting in their generality. In this paper, we present work on Bayesian affect control theory as a more comprehensive, yet highly parsimonious model that integrates artificial intelligence, social psychology, and emotions into a single predictive model of human activities in groups. We illustrate these developments with examples from an ongoing research project aimed at computational analysis of virtual software development teams.",

          "Analytical sociology is concerned with mechanism-based explanations of collective phenomena in socially interdependent systems. Social interdependencies make identifying the processes that generate collective outcomes a challenging task, however, and their study typically requires research designs that differ from those traditionally used by sociologists. The availability of time-stamped networked datasets, the rapid progress in computational power, and the development of new methodological tools in the field of computational social science have enabled detailed analyses of large populations of interacting individuals in different social environments. This has, in turn, opened the door to detailed, empirically grounded investigations of the micro-level dynamics that give rise to macro-level phenomena. These advances are important because they help close the gap between theoretical and empirical work in sociology, in ways that should be instructive for the field of computational social science.",
          "The growing application of collaborative technologies to C4ISR greatly increases communication and coordination, but poses a hidden threat. When the same set of people interact frequently with one another, they grow to think more and more along the same lines, a phenomenon we call “collective cognitive convergence ” (C3). The higher the collaborative bandwidth, the faster this convergence, and the greater the danger that the group will collapse prematurely to a single perspective, becoming blind to strategic alternatives. We review previous work in sociology, computational social science, and evolutionary biology that sheds light on C3; define a computational model for the convergence process and quantitative metrics that can be used to study it; report on experiments with this model and metric; and suggest how the insights from this model can inspire techniques for managing C3 in C4ISR.",
          "Information sharing is a core human activity that catalyzes innovation and development. Recent advances in neuroscience reveal information about the psychological mechanisms that drive sharing, with a particular focus on self-relevance, social cognition, and subjective value. Based on these insights, this chapter proposes a structural model of the neurocognitive and psychological processes that drive sharing decisions, called value-based virality. Further, it maps existing knowledge about neural correlates and moderators of thought processes linked to individual and population-level sharing events and outcomes and suggests avenues for future investigation. Finally, the chapter discusses the potential of the neuroscience of information sharing to interact productively with other methodological traditions such as computational social science. Initial neuroimaging studies of information sharing provide insights into psychological mechanisms that were previously inaccessible. With the development of more realistic experimental setups and multimethod designs, future efforts promise advances toward a unifying theory of why and how people share information.",
          "Attractor models provide a generalized way to represent processes found throughout science. A fuller articulation of the attractor framework requires that it be addressed qualitatively and conceptually as a nonlinear mathematical order residing between cyclical and random processes. Many significant nonlinear social processes have been identified and analyzed in classical social theory. These include the circulation of the elites (Pareto), cultural dynamics (Sorokin), social differentiation (Durkheim) and rationalization in modern institutions (Weber). The present discussion develops a qualitative consideration of such classical social processes as attractor systems, and discusses possible applications of such models in computational social science.",
          "Analytical sociology is beginning to embrace a digital revolution in the collection and analysis of social data and is increasingly drawing on tools from computational social science (CSS) to pursue its goals of mechanism-based explanation of aggregate outcomes. In this chapter, we highlight the ways in which analytical sociologists are using CSS tools to further social research. Using agent-based modeling, large-scale online experiments, digital trace data, and natural language processing, analytical sociologists are identifying how large-scale properties of social systems emerge from the complex interactions of networked actors at lower scales. At the same time, we provide a perspective on how CSS techniques can be successfully deployed in social research, including ways in which they can be productively combined. Computational tools, when applied using a theory-grounded approach, offer sociologists a chance to transcend the limitations of the dominant survey-research paradigm and finally address “big” sociological questions about, for example, the nature of culture, the emergence of inequality, and the dynamics of segregation. We also discuss how computational social scientists can take cues from analytical sociology to further hone their own research and methods in the service of theoretically grounded, mechanism-based explanations, moving beyond theoretically thin descriptions or predictions of micro- and macro-level outcomes.",

          "Social psychology plays a crucial role as the theoretical and empirical link between the dynamics of human psychology and the macroscopic patterns of social systems. It is all about social interaction, socialization, small groups, values, and so forth. We touch upon some of these topics in our review of The Self (Chapter 10) and in Collective Behaviour, Mass Psychology and Social Movements (Chapter 19). Still, many of these topics, particularly from a sociological perspective, are not central to the complexity sciences. Two fields of study address this absence: dynamical social psychology and computational social science (i.e., social simulation). This chapter explores these two fields to inspire readers to see the importance of integrating a complex social psychology into their various studies of social complexity.",

          "There has been significant growth in online social science experiments in order to understand behavior at-scale, with finer-grained data collection. Considerable work is required to perform data analytics for custom experiments. In this dissertation, we design and build composable and extensible automated software pipelines for evaluating social phenomena through iterative experiments and modeling. To reason about experiments and models, we design a formal data model. This combined approach of experiments and models has been done in some studies without automation, or purely conceptually.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nWe are motivated by a particular social behavior, namely collective identity (CI). Group or CI is an individual's cognitive, moral, and emotional connection with a broader community, category, practice, or institution. Extensive experimental research shows that CI influences human decision-making. Because of this, there is interest in modeling situations that promote the creation of CI in order to learn more from the process and to predict human behavior in real life situations.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nOne of our goals in this dissertation is to understand whether a cooperative anagram game can produce CI within a group. With all of the experimental work on anagram games, it is surprising that very little work has been done in modeling these games. Also, abduction is an inference approach that uses data and observations to identify plausibly (and preferably, best) explanations for phenomena. Abduction has broad application in robotics, genetics, automated systems, and image understanding, but have largely been devoid of human behavior. We use these pipelines to understand intra-group cooperation and its effect on fostering CI. We devise and execute an iterative abductive analysis process that is driven by the social sciences.&#13;\\n&#13;\\nIn a group anagrams web-based networked game setting, we formalize an abductive loop, implement it computationally, and exercise it; we build and evaluate three agent-based models (ABMs) through a set of composable and extensible pipelines; we also analyze experimental data and develop mechanistic and data-driven models of human reasoning to predict detailed game player action. The agreement between model predictions and experimental data indicate that our models can explain behavior and provide novel experimental insights into CI."

          "Digital data on human behaviour and social interactions are a seemingly abundant and valuable resource of the twenty-first century, promising deep insights into the social processes generating them. Such data - commonly referred to as digital trace data, process-generated data, or digital behavioural data - are increasingly available to us, but the goal of unlocking their potential remains elusive despite the emergence of specialized fields such as computational social science, which has produced an ample body of research based on this resource. Achieving that goal requires revisiting the foundations of research based on this data type, a thorough understanding of its unique characteristics, overcoming access barriers, understanding data generating processes, and rethinking the role of theory at the intersection between computer science and social science. This chapter discusses the origin and characteristics of such data, as well as the interdisciplinary challenges researchers face in accessing, understanding, and using it for research.",
          "AbstractIn the growing trend of research using digital trace data to study human activities and opinions across different contexts, networked China has emerged as a prominent area of interest. However, research that critically examines the use, strengths, and weaknesses of existing digital trace methods, and the extent to which they can reveal the true landscape of digital China remains limited. To address these gaps, this study proposes a framework for examining and evaluating the knowledge production of digital trace research within a sociotechnical system comprising state actors, platform governance, digital civil society, and international forces. We then provide the first empirical examination of the knowledge claims and epistemic approaches used in digital trace communication scholarship that has studied China across different phases in the past 30 years. Grounded in the resulting empirical evidence, we discuss two common practices in existing digital trace research on China, how these approaches and perspectives could affect the validity and reliability of offering diverse viewpoints for studying and understanding digital China, and directions for improving these practices.Keywords: Digital traceknowledge productionevidence-driven approachChinasociotechnical systemcomputational social science AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Steve Meyer, the data strategist from the University of Wisconsin–Madison Libraries, for helping us retrieve data from the Web of Science database.

          "The continuously growing use of digital services has provided social scientists with an expanding reservoir of data, potentially holding valuable insights into human behavior and social systems. This has often been associated with the terms \"big data\" and \"computational social science.\" Using such data, social scientists have argued, will enable us to better understand social, political, and economic life. Yet this new data type comes not only with promises but with challenges as well. These include developing standards for data collection, preparation, analysis, and reporting; establishing more systematic links between established theories within the existing body of research in the social sciences; and moving away from proofs-of-concepts toward the systematic development and testing of hypotheses. In this article, we map these promises and challenges in detail and introduce five highly innovative contributions collected in this special issue. These articles illustrate impressively the potential of digital trace data in the social science all the while remaining conscious of its pitfalls.",
          "The John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood (CFCIP) allocates funding to provide services to youth who are likely to age out of foster care. These services, covering everything from mentoring to financial aid, are expected to be distributed in ways that prepare youth for life after care. However, surprisingly little is known about which youth receive which services. The present work makes use of the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), a large-scale administrative dataset that tracks services allocated to youth that use CFCIP funds. Specifically, we conduct a forensic social science analysis of the NYTD data. To do so, we first use computational methods to help us uncover the most important factors associated with service receipt. Doing so helps us to identify three major factors-youth age, youth time in care, and the state in which a youth is in care-that are most heavily associated with service receive. We then conduct an analysis that links existing theory to these factors, expanding our understanding of how services are allocated and paving the way to future work to understand why such associations exist.",
          "In recent years, a variety of novel digital data sources, colloquially referred to as “big data,” have taken the popular imagination by storm. These data sources include but are not limited to: digitized administrative records; activity on and contents of social media and internet platforms; and readings from sensors that track physical and environmental conditions. Some have argued that such data sets have the potential to transform our understanding of human behavior and society, constituting a meta-field known as computational social science. Such work has also required methodological advances that make the content of the data accessible and interpretable. How these promises and challenges manifest is specific to the questions and themes of a given discipline, and this bibliography summarizes how big data have been leveraged to further multiple lines of inquiry in the study of communities and crime.",

We also describe opportunities for expanding these research agendas by using other digital trace data, and discuss various promising paths to increase researcher access to the required data, which is often collected and owned by private corporations.",
          "Abstract This paper aims to provide a historical context in which to appreciate the shared problems faced by social and computer scientists in using and creating biometric data. While historians of science are well aware of the trials (and errors) of previous attempts to quantify the human condition, this literature has not always made it into discussions of modern biometrics. Indeed, manuals for what are now called the computational social sciences often imagine that data mining and statistical averages are new, and that “Big Data” has only existed for the past decade. Such historical amnesia has led, this paper argues, to problems of modern bias emerging in the literature as a technical issue rather than a full-fledged conceptual barrier with long roots. Seen only in the light of present politics and practical concerns, I argue that these problems will remain intractable.",
          "ABSTRACTThe adoption of the online tax filing and payment system by enterprises offer several benefits such as less transaction costs, efficient public management, avoiding human errors, and eliminating repetitive hand tasks. This study analyses the factors affecting the adoption of the online tax filing and payment system by 437 micro, small, and medium enterprises in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The study employs an adoption model using technology acceptance model and information system success model with social influence. Structural equation modelling is used to evaluate the proposed research model. Results suggest that micro, small, and medium enterprises users perceived that a precise information quality, accessible system quality, and responsive service quality in the online filing and payment system important for their adoption to the system. Social influence does not affect their intention to adopt the online filing and payment system. Policy makers and information technology providers should regularly update precise information, be responsive assistant, provide an accessible system, and simplify the online filing and payment procedure to increase the adoption of the system. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the context of online tax services used by business users by expanding the Technology Acceptance Model through incorporating external variables from the Information System Success Model and social influence.KEYWORDS: Adoptiondigital government servicemicro small and medium enterprises, Vietnam AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the companies’ representatives for sharing opinions on their online filing and payment system adoption.

These data sources include, but are not limited to, digitized administrative records, activity on and contents of social media and internet platforms, and readings from sensors that track physical and environmental conditions. Some have argued that such data sets have the potential to transform our understanding of human behavior and society, constituting a meta-field known as computational social science.

          "Dynamics of social processes in populations, such as the spread of emotions, influence, opinions, and mass movements (often referred to individually and collectively as contagions), are increasingly studied because of their economic, social, and political impacts. Moreover, multiple contagions may interact and hence studying their simultaneous evolution is important. Within the context of social media, large datasets involving many tens of millions of people are leading to new insights into human behavior, and these datasets continue to grow in size. Through social media, contagions can readily cross national boundaries, as evidenced by the 2011 Arab Spring. These and other observations guide our work. Our goal is to study contagion processes at scale with an approach that permits intricate descriptions of interactions among members of a population. Our contributions are a modeling environment to perform these computations and a set of approaches to predict contagion spread size and to block the spread of contagions. Since we represent populations as networks, we also provide insights into network structure effects, and present and analyze a new model of contagion dynamics that represents a person\\\\'s behavior in repeatedly joining and withdrawing from collective action. We study variants of problems for different classes of social contagions, including those known as simple and complex contagions.",
          "The Social Identity Model of Recovery (SIMOR) suggests that addiction recovery is a journey through time where membership in various groups facilitates success. With the help of computational approaches, we now have access to new resources to study whether a wide variety of different online communities can be part of the addiction recovery journey. In this work, we study the effects of two main social factors on recovery success: first, multiple group membership defined in terms of richness of online community engagement; second, active participation operationalized as the evenness in engagement with these groups. We then model recovery from addiction by applying the extended Cox regression model which accounts for the effect of these two factors on time to relapse. We applied our analysis to a dataset of 457 recovering opioid addicts that self-announced the date of their recovery, indicating that at least 219 (48%) addicts relapsed during the recovery period. We find that multiple group membership - in terms of the number of other forums that a subject had posted in - as well as active participation - in terms of how evenly their posts were spread amongst the different forums - reduced the risk of relapse. We discuss our findings with regards to the opportunity, but also risk, that online group membership poses for recovering opioid addicts, as well as the possible contribution that computational social science methods can make to the study of addiction and recovery.",
          "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant persuasive capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges, remains underexplored. This paper addresses the research question: \\emph{Can LLMs generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?} To answer this, we propose a pipeline using reinforcement learning with simulated feedback, where the network's response to LLM-generated content (i.e., the reward) is simulated through a formal engagement model. This approach bypasses the temporal cost and complexity of live experiments, enabling an efficient feedback loop between the LLM and the network under study. It also allows to control over endogenous factors such as the LLM's position within the social network and the distribution of opinions on a given topic. Our approach is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. Such flexibility makes it suitable for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science. Using our framework, we analyze the performance of LLMs in generating social engagement under different conditions, showcasing their full potential in this task. The experimental code is publicly available at https://github.com/mminici/Engagement-Driven-Content-Generation.",
          "Social media engagement prediction is a central challenge in computational social science, particularly for understanding how users interact with misinformation.

We introduce \\textsc{Dreams} (\\underline{D}isentangled \\underline{R}epresentations and \\underline{E}pisodic \\underline{A}daptive \\underline{M}odeling for \\underline{S}ocial media misinformation engagements), a social exchange theory-guided framework that models misinformation engagement as a dynamic process of social exchange.

It integrates adaptive mechanisms to learn how emotional and contextual signals propagate through time and across platforms. On a cross-platform dataset spanning $7$ platforms and 2.37M posts collected between 2021 and 2025, \\textsc{Dreams} achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting misinformation engagements, reaching a mean absolute percentage error of $19.25$\\%. This is a $43.6$\\% improvement over the strongest baseline.

          "Computational social science is an emerging interdisciplinary field which uses computational techniques to model, simulate and analyze human behavior and social phenomena, typically by leveraging the power of big data. Some researchers in this field use the records of actions taken by players in online games, meaning that they obtain a large amount of human behavioral data without explicitly conducting experiments with human subjects. This study investigates the mechanism of a social phenomenon called behavioral bursts which occur in a social networking game with over 7 million players. We define a behavioral burst as an increase in average points obtained by players that goes over the estimated value by a threshold. The results show that the burst patterns are classified into two classes depending on their cause. One is exogenous burst, caused by external factors (e.g. end of events), and the other is endogenous burst, caused by player interaction. We then investigate the change in the behavior of players between before and during the bursts, and find that only a small number of players are involved in them in case of endogenous bursts. Furthermore, by focusing on the action sequences of players obtaining many points, we find that they communicate with other players in a modest number of times, and in the case of endogenous bursts they tend to exchange information with a fixed player.",
          "Understanding how emotions diffuse through social networks is central to computational social science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to simulate social media interactions, raising the question of whether LLM-generated data can realistically reproduce emotion diffusion patterns observed in real online communities. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison between emotion diffusion in real-world social graphs and in LLM-simulated interaction networks. We construct diffusion graphs from Reddit discussion data and compare them with synthetic social graphs generated through LLM-driven conversational simulations. Emotion states are inferred using established sentiment analysis pipelines, and both real and simulated graphs are analyzed from structural, behavioral, and predictive perspectives. Our results reveal substantial structural and dynamic discrepancies between real and simulated diffusion processes. Real-world emotion diffusion exhibits dense connectivity, repeated interactions, sentiment shifts, and emergent community structures, whereas LLM-simulated graphs largely consist of isolated linear chains with monotonic emotional trajectories. These structural limitations significantly affect downstream tasks such as graph-based emotion prediction, leading to reduced emotional diversity and class imbalance in simulated settings. Our findings highlight current limitations of LLM-based social simulation in capturing the interactive complexity and emotional heterogeneity of real social networks. This work provides empirical evidence for the cautious use of LLM-generated data in social science research and suggests directions for improving future simulation frameworks.",
          "Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to face-to-face communications, human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms underlying this emotion contagion, for example, whether different feelings spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals, online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that weaker ties speed up anger by applying both propagation velocity and coverage metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. With the extensive proliferation of weak ties in booming social media, our results imply that the contagion of anger could be profoundly strengthened to globalize its negative impact.",
          "How does network structure affect diffusion? Recent studies suggest that the answer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it is. We present a practical method to translate data about community structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely. This connection contributes to our understanding in computational social science, social media analytics, and marketing applications.",
          "The containment of misinformation diffusion on social media is a critical challenge in computational social science. However, prevailing intervention strategies predominantly rely on static topological metrics or time-agnostic learning models, thereby overlooking the profound impact of temporal–demographic heterogeneity. This oversight frequently results in a “spatio-temporal mismatch”, where limited intervention resources are misallocated to structurally central but temporarily inactive nodes, particularly during non-stationary propagation bursts driven by exogenous triggers. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Deep Reinforcement Learning (ST-DRL) framework for proactive misinformation defense. By seamlessly integrating continuous trigonometric time encoding with demographic-aware Graph Attention Networks, our model explicitly captures the coupling dynamics between group-specific circadian rhythms and event-driven transmission surges. Extensive simulations on heterogeneous networks demonstrate that ST-DRL achieves a Peak Prevalence Reduction of 93.2%, significantly outperforming static heuristics and approaching the theoretical upper bound of oracle-assisted baselines. Crucially, interpretability analysis reveals that the agent autonomously evolves a “Preemptive Strike” strategy—prioritizing the sanitization of high-risk bridge nodes, such as bots, prior to event onsets—thus establishing a new paradigm for predictive rather than reactive network governance.",

          "For more than a decade social media have connected people virtually, thereby creating digital social networks with different purposes and affordances. People typically co‐orient, leading to some content going viral and becoming “contagious” for other network members. Importantly, the complex contagion phenomenon can now be captured more easily using digital tools that became part of the method arsenal in computational social science. Conceptually, social contagion describes a nonpermanent event that, when it occurs, develops over time with specific social network dynamics. It can be assessed using both observational and controlled study designs that, importantly, also come with novel ethical challenges that need to be considered. Identifying social media influencers using centrality measures can be the starting point for measuring social media contagion, thus understanding the social contagion dynamics as “rippling effects” following a “three degrees of influence rule” within social networks of connected members, friends, and friends of friends. Over time, the contagion establishes itself as part of temporal clustering and as a result of a human tendency for assortative mixing and homophilic preferences. In combination with centrality measures and indicators for network homogeneity, the lifetime of social media content is a good measure to further describe not only the dynamics behind the adoption of viral content on social media, but also the emergence of echo chambers.",
          "Social media hashtags function as critical organizational markers in digital discourse, yet traditional weighting methods fail to capture their dynamic significance across temporal and contextual dimensions. This paper presents a novel thermodynamic framework that conceptualizes social network activity as system &#x201C;temperature&#x201D;, applying statistical mechanics principles to model hashtag importance as process innovation. We establish mathematical foundations based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, providing an information-theoretic justification for dynamic hashtag weighting. Our approach incorporates activation thresholds and power-law scaling behaviors through a temperature-dependent function, with Simple Moving Average techniques implemented to stabilize temperature estimation, mathematically reducing variance by a factor of 1/N. Empirical evaluation using Twitter discourse from the US Presidential Election demonstrates unprecedented improvements in clustering performance: Silhouette Scores increased from 0.0126 to 0.9070 for Trump-related content and from 0.0105 to 0.8220 for Biden-related content, while Calinski-Harabasz Scores improved from 65.51 to nearly 98 million. These findings establish a rigorous mathematical bridge between thermodynamic systems and social media behavior, contributing to computational social science by providing a theoretical framework that significantly enhances discourse community detection in politically polarized environments. The approach enables more accurate identification of topic clusters, revealing distinct discourse patterns that conventional methods fail to capture.",

          "We propose a concept of structural equality as a compromise between competing policy preferences of equality and individual liberty to address a stunning property of the governance of corporations, namely, the paucity of female directors on corporate boards. An argument for imposing a quota for women directors on boards is the need to disrupt structural impediments to permit endogenous mechanisms to sustain female recruitment beyond a critical mass. Using estimates from the Norwegian experiment, we apply an agent‐based model to American board data to show that modest numerical quotas generate well‐connected networks of women directors who attain equality in their centrality and influence. The analysis demonstrates the utility of computational social science for identifying policies that generate alternative and possible worlds of greater structural equality .

          "Studying gender presents unique challenges to data science. Recent work in the spirit of computational social science returns to critical approach to operationalisation providing a fresh perspective on this important topic. In this chapter we highlight works that examines gender computationally, describing how they employ levels of feminist theory to challenge gender inequality at the micro, meso, and macro level. We argue that paying critical attention to how we infer and analyze gender is fruitfully in understanding society and the contributions of research. We also present various sources and methods to infer gender and provide examples of the application of such methods. We conclude by outlining the way forward for computational methods in how gender and intersectional inequality is studied.This is a draft.

          "There is constant under-representation of women and racial minorities in the research workforce. Past research has demonstrated considerable gender and ethnic disparities in conventional scientific outcomes including careers, funding, publications, and citations. However, addressing the issue of under-representation requires examining the disparities throughout the scientific pipeline from the process of knowledge production to their dissemination in online media. Furthermore, a sizable gap still remains in our understanding of the mechanisms behind these disparities, which can involve different actors and institutions. For instance, the gap in publication counts at leading journals may be caused by the submission volume or the acceptance rate, which in turn may be caused by meritorious factors or bias in review. Disentangling different mechanisms is thus essential for designing effective policy interventions to restore equality in science. In this dissertation, we utilize large-scale bibliometric data, including publicly available datasets and private peer-review data from leading academic journals, to examine the demographic disparities and explore their potential mechanisms in three key activities in science production and dissemination, including (1) ethnic disparity in acceptance rate at top biology journals, (2) ethnic disparity in author mentions in science news, and (3) gender differences in scholarly self-promotion on social media. We leverage novel computational techniques and statistical models to precisely measure the magnitude of the disparities. The fine-grained nature of these data also enables us to pinpoint the actors (e.g., journal editors or peer reviewers) and processes (e.g., publishing stage or dissemination stage) where the disparity is produced, and dig into the mechanisms leading to it. We demonstrate how this computational social science approach can provide insights into practical policy interventions to reduce disparity in science.",
          "Scientists’ identities and social locations influence their work, but the content of scientific work can also influence scientists. Theory from feminist science studies, autoethnographic accounts, interviews, and experiments indicate that the substance of scientific research can have profound effects on how scientists are treated by colleagues and their sense of belonging in science. I bring together these disparate literatures under the framework of professional cultures. Drawing on the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Web of Science, I use computational social science tools to argue that the way scientists write about sex in their research influences the future gender ratio of PhDs awarded across 53 subfields of the life sciences over a span of 47 years. Specifically, I show that a critical paradigm of “feminist biology” that seeks to de-essentialize sex and gender corresponds to increases in women’s graduation rates, whereas “sex difference” research—sometimes called “neurosexism” because of its emphasis on essential, categorical differences—corresponds to decreases in women’s graduation rates in most fields.",
          "The percentage of women in academia is still lower than what would be expected statistically, especially in the sciences and among faculty (tenured professors). Theories on the “glass-ceiling effect” suggest that men form exclusive professional networks among other men, while women remain systematically outside. With this paper, we aim to shed some light on this by exploiting a dataset that tracks sensor-based interaction behavior at four academic conferences in the field of Computational Social Science. We look at the number of minutes junior academics interact with tenured professors during the lunch and coffee breaks of these conferences. If glass-ceiling theory holds, we expect to see that female junior academics show fewer interactions to seniors, especially to male seniors. We also expect to see that junior women interact more often than junior men with lower-level academics. While we indeed find evidence for this last hypothesis, we do not find evidence for the first two expectations. We find that junior women show more interactions then men to senior scholars, especially to male professors, but also to female professors. Overall, we do not find evidence for one important mechanism of the glass-ceiling effect, namely, that male gatekeepers exclusively interact with males only, at least not at a conference setting and with this type of measure.",

          "Abstract The percentage of women in academia is still lower than what would be expected statistically, especially in the sciences and among faculty (tenured professors).

          "Scientists’ identities and social locations influence their work, but the content of scientific work can also influence scientists. Theory from feminist science studies, autoethnographic accounts, interviews, and experiments indicate that the substance of scientific research can have profound effects on how scientists are treated by colleagues and their sense of belonging in science. I bring together this disparate literature under the framework of professional cultures and show population-level trends supporting it. Drawing on the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Web of Science, I use computational social science tools to argue that the way scientists write about sex in their research influences the future gender ratio of PhDs awarded across 53 subfields of the life sciences over a span of 47 years. Specifically, I show that a critical paradigm of “feminist biology” that seeks to de-essentialize sex and gender corresponds to increases in women’s graduation rates, while “sex difference” research—sometimes called “neurosexism” because of its emphasis on essential, categorical differences—has negative effects on women’s graduation rates in most fields."

          "Social media data provide unprecedented access to discussions of active, naturalistic, and often real-time cannabis use in an era of cannabis policy liberalization. The aim of this study was to explore psychological and environmental correlates of cannabis effects by applying computational social science approaches to a large dataset of unprompted reports of naturalistic cannabis use with corresponding self-reported numerical ratings of subjective highness. Post title text was extracted via the Pushshift dataset from N = 328,865 posts to the r/trees Reddit community, where posters self-assess and disclose how high they feel on a scale from 1 to 10 ( M = 6.9, SD = 1.8). Structural topic modelling and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary-based approaches were applied to identify (1) frequently discussed topics and (2) text indicative of 5 psychological processes (affective, social, cognitive, perceptual, biological), respectively, as well as to examine relationships between subjective highness and (1) topic prevalence and (2) psychological process word counts. A 40-topic model was selected for interpretation based on semantic coherence and exclusivity. The most discussed topics in a 40-topic model were characterized by references to smoking places, social contexts, positive affect, cognitive states, as well as food and media consumed. In LIWC dictionary analyses, words mentioning affective, social, and cognitive processes were referenced more often than perceptual or body processes. Posters reported greater subjective highness when using language that referred to in-person social environments and lower subjective highness when using language that referred to online social environments and positive affect psychological states. This examination of unprompted online reports of naturalistic cannabis use identified textual content referring to affect and to other people as being associated with perceived effects of cannabis. These affective and social aspects of the cannabis use experience were salient to active posters in this online community and should be integrated into experience sampling methods and behavioral pharmacology research, as well as public health messaging.",
          "Practitioners dealing with large text collections frequently use topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) in their projects to explore trends. Despite twenty years of accrued advancement in natural language processing tools, these models are found to be slow and challenging to apply to text exploration projects. In our work, we engaged with practitioners (n=15) who use topic modeling to explore trends in large text collections to understand their project workflows and investigate which factors often slow down the processes and how they deal with such errors and interruptions in automated topic modeling. Our findings show that practitioners are required to diagnose and resolve context-specific problems with preparing data and models and need control for these steps, especially for data cleaning and parameter selection. Our major findings resonate with existing work across CSCW, computational social science, machine learning, data science, and digital humanities. They also leave us questioning whether automation is actually a useful goal for tools designed for topic models and text exploration.",

          "This inductive examination of the topics in the public administration literature using computational social science and corpus linguistics (17 journals, N=12,760 articles, 1991–2019) reveals a new landscape of public administration topics, changes in topics over time and their distribution: • Topic modelling of the stock of the whole corpus identifies 50 topics: the top ten topics included health care, federal government, performance management, environmental regulation, HRM and networks and accounted for just over a third of scholarship between 1991–2019. • Focal topics identified in individual journals identified similarities with popular topics in the whole corpus – networks, health care, HRM – and less frequently examined topics including gender and diversity and partnerships. • Analysis of topics over time shows a substantial flow in topics moving from a country and practice focus in the early stages of our study period to concepts such as governance, networks and citizens in the late stages (2015–2019).",
          "Abstract As the use of computational text analysis in the social sciences has increased, topic modeling has emerged as a popular method for identifying latent themes in textual data. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the results produced by this method, given that it is largely automated and inductive in nature, and the lack of clear guidelines for validating topic models has been identified by scholars as an area of concern. In response, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of 789 studies that employ topic modeling. Our goal is to investigate whether the field is moving toward a common framework for validating these models. The findings of our review indicate a notable absence of standardized validation practices and a lack of convergence toward specific methods of validation. This gap may be attributed to the inherent incompatibility between the inductive, qualitative approach of topic modeling and the deductive, quantitative tradition that favors standardized validation. To address this, we advocate for incorporating qualitative validation approaches, emphasizing transparency and detailed reporting to improve the credibility of findings in computational social science research when using topic modeling.",
          "This paper presents the practical application of big language models in text mining and topic modeling processes using texts shared online by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Türkiye. The research describes an iterative and hybrid algorithm in which domain experts and large language models work together. The findings indicate that well-defined themes play a critical role in model success. It is emphasized that in social sciences, topic modeling processes should be handled with a \"tailor-made\"approach that includes the contextual interpretations of the researcher in the data evaluation processes, rather than being evaluated only through numerical outputs. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm offers a comprehensive and flexible analysis opportunity in social scientific research by generating topic labels suitable for qualitative or quantitative analysis of texts.",
          "Decarbonisation is an urgent, global challenge now widely recognised by policymakers, researchers, businesses and citizens alike. While decarbonisation presents a systemic challenge to our societies, it is increasingly framed as a political challenge. Shifting towards a fossil free future is a value-laden process, prone to political contestation. It is thus critical to examine politics and policy processes that influence and condition energy system change.\\n\\nThis dissertation advances research on decarbonisation policy and politics by exploring methodological questions that help improve synergies between policy studies and energy transition studies. It sets out to answer the following research question: What novel contributions can textual methodologies bring to the study of decarbonisation policy and politics, both in terms of methods and empirical insights? The dissertation takes an interest in discursive approaches and unsupervised machine learning methods, in particular that of topic modelling, while having decarbonisation as the empirical context.\\n\\nThe methodological exploration is carried out on two levels. First, the potential and limitations of each group of method are studied on the meta-level. Second, each method is applied to an empirical case. A topic modelling analysis is conducted on the development of the European Energy Union project, while the decline of coal-fired power generation in the United Kingdom is examined through a discourse analysis. \\n\\nThe findings indicate that discursive methodologies can enhance our understanding of the role of political ideology and state orientation, publics, institutional and policy change in decarbonisation processes. In addition, discursive approaches are found to complement the classical energy transition frameworks. The examination of topic modelling shows that while the method can be used to examine policy-relevant corpora with an unprecedented scale and scope, seeking to gain straightforward qualitative or policy relevant value from the topic modelling output risks being misleading. \\n\\nAs a novel methodological contribution, this dissertation suggests that topic modelling brings added value to textual analysis when used in mixed-method designs. To exemplify this, the study proposes embedded and sequential designs for incorporating topic modelling into the analytical processes of different qualitative textual methods. Taken together, the findings encourage scholars to further experiment with the use of computer mediated textual analysis approaches in practice. \\n\\nThis study also highlights several higher level implications for research and policy. It calls for in-depth methodological dialogue among computational scientists, statistical experts and social scientists. This is because developing computational social science approaches requires that the models are designed to match the real-world societal phenomena they are applied to. Furthermore, the results provide important lessons learnt for transition scholars and policy-makers. The UK case shows that coal declined rapidly and with relatively little resistance by incumbent actors. The results also reveal how the Energy Union’s policy priorities have been increasingly geared towards decarbonisation objectives by furthering policy convergence between climate-security and energy efficiency-affordability paradigms.",
          "Comparing and contrasting qualitative and quantitative methods for social media data exploration, this article describes and demonstrates the topic modeling approach for the descriptive analysis of large unstructured text data. Using a sample of tweets with the #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft hashtags (n = 3,068), a Twitter conversation describing the reasons individuals left or stayed in abusive relationships, a traditional thematic analysis was used to qualitatively code the tweets. The same tweet sample was subject to a series of quantitative topic models. Results suggest topic modeling as a comparable approach to first-round qualitative analysis, with key differences: topic modeling and traditional thematic analysis are both inductive and phenomenon-oriented, but topic modeling results in a lexical semantic analysis, in contrast to the compositional semantic analysis offered by the qualitative approach. An evaluation of topics and codes using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software further supports these findings. We argue topic modeling is a useful method for the descriptive analysis of unstructured social media data sets, and is best used as part of a mixed-method strategy, with topic model results guiding deeper qualitative analysis. Implications for human service intervention development and evaluation are discussed.",
          "Purpose This paper aims to use text mining methods to explore the similarities and differences between countries’ national digital transformation (DT) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) policies. The study examines the applicability of text mining as an alternative for comprehensive clustering of national I4.0 and DT strategies, encouraging policy researchers toward data science that can offer rapid policy analysis and benchmarking. Design/methodology/approach With an exploratory research approach, topic modeling, principal component analysis and unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means and hierarchical clustering) are used for clustering national I4.0 and DT strategies. This paper uses a corpus of policy documents and related scientific publications from several countries and integrate their science and technology performance. The paper also presents the positioning of Türkiye’s I4.0 and DT national policy as a case from a developing country context. Findings Text mining provides meaningful clustering results on similarities and differences between countries regarding their national I4.0 and DT policies, aligned with their geographic, economic and political circumstances. Findings also shed light on the DT strategic landscape and the key themes spanning various policy dimensions. Drawing from the Turkish case, political options are discussed in the context of developing (follower) countries’ I4.0 and DT. Practical implications The paper reveals meaningful clustering results on similarities and differences between countries regarding their national I4.0 and DT policies, reflecting political proximities aligned with their geographic, economic and political circumstances. This can help policymakers to comparatively understand national DT and I4.0 policies and use this knowledge to reflect collaborative and competitive measures to their policies. Originality/value This paper provides a unique combined methodology for text mining-based policy analysis in the DT context, which has not been adopted. In an era where computational social science and machine learning have gained importance and adaptability to political and social science fields, and in the technology and innovation management discipline, clustering applications showed similar and different policy patterns in a timely and unbiased manner.",
          "Abstract The possible existence of a research‐practice gap is the topic of a long‐standing debate in the field of public administration. In this Viewpoint essay, the authors examine the agendas of scholars and practitioners using the topic modeling technique of computational social science. Topic modeling a content analysis of 35 topics identified in Public Administration Review and PA Times (3,796 articles) showed that just over 50 percent of topics were common to both groups, indicating shared interests. There were, however, topics that the two groups distinctly focused on. Moreover, scholars and practitioners attached significant differences to the weights allocated to the prominent topics in their writing. Taken together, these findings indicate that topic modeling can shed new light on the research‐practice gap in public administration .",
          "ABSTRACT In this paper, we explore new approaches for combining manual and automatic content analysis. We compare three approaches to topic modelling: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). We applied all three approaches to study a corpus of 21,085 free‐response answers to questions from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. We built topic models using the algorithms. Our preliminary results indicate that LSA and LDA yielded more useful results than HDP. We thematically analyzed the topic models and found similarities and differences in the factors that influenced patients' satisfaction with doctors and nurses.",
          "Rapid growth over the past two decades in digitized textual information represents untapped potential for methodological innovations in the adaptation governance literature that draw on machine learning approaches already being applied in other areas of computational social sciences. This Focus Article explores the potential for text mining techniques, specifically topic modeling, to leverage this data for large‐scale analysis of the content of adaptation policy documents. We provide an overview of the assumptions and procedures that underlie the use of topic modeling, and discuss key areas in the adaptation governance literature where topic modeling could provide valuable insights. We demonstrate the diversity of potential applications for topic modeling with two examples that examine: (a) how adaptation is being talked about by political leaders in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; and (b) how adaptation is being discussed by decision‐makers and public administrators in Canadian municipalities using documents collected from 25 city council archives. This article is categorized under: Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change &gt; Institutions for Adaptation",
          "Reconciling strategic alignment with local innovation is a core governance challenge for policy experimentation zones worldwide. This study investigates this challenge by elucidating the operational dynamics of multi-level governance in China, using the unique Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin as a natural laboratory for institutional experimentation. Integrating semantic network analysis (SNA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, we systematically analyze 623 policy documents from 2009 to 2024, spanning four administrative levels: national, provincial, municipal, and cooperation zone. Our findings reveal a “functional differentiation pyramid” governance architecture, where the national level provides strategic guidance, while lower-level governments engage in significant issue disaggregation and reorganization during implementation. We find that policy transmission across levels is not a linear replication but a dynamic process we term “adaptive reconstruction”—a form of institutional work actively undertaken by subnational governments to enhance policy fitness. We argue that this mechanism is key to how the governance system simultaneously maintains strategic coherence and local flexibility. The results provide new empirical evidence for multi-level governance (MLG) theory. This “Hengqin model” contributes to global governance debates by empirically demonstrating a distinct architecture for policy implementation, while also showcasing the potential of computational social science in policy analysis.",
          "Abstract Topic modeling as an instrument of probabilistic clustering for text collections has gained particular attention within the computational social science in Russia. This chapter looks at how topic modeling techniques have been developed and employed by the Russian scholars, both for Russian and other languages. We divide the works on topic modeling into methodological, applied, relational, and those dedicated to modeling quality assessment. While the methodological studies are the most developed, the works explaining the substance of the Russian-language discussions cover an important niche in political and social science. However, there is a gap between method-oriented works that treat Russian as “language as such” and the works by computational linguists who focus on Russian but treat topic modeling as a method of secondary importance."

          "In this paper, we address the problem of detecting expressions of moral values in tweets using content analysis. This is a particularly challenging problem because moral values are often only implicitly signaled in language, and tweets contain little contextual information due to length constraints. To address these obstacles, we present a novel approach to automatically acquire background knowledge from an external knowledge base to enrich input texts and thus improve moral value prediction. By combining basic text features with background knowledge, our overall context-aware framework achieves performance comparable to a single human annotator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate background knowledge for the prediction of implicit psychological variables in the area of computational social science.",

          "Social scientists have long sought to explain why social norms vary so dramatically across the globe, but creating predictive, falsifiable models has remained a major challenge. Here, we introduce and validate the Moral Flavors Model, a quantitative framework that accurately predicts a society's judgment of a specific behavior. Our model is built on two components: the intrinsic 'moral flavor' of a behavior (the type of concern it evokes, such as harm or impurity) and a society's 'moral taste' (its sensitivity to these different flavors). By combining global survey data with robust cross-validation, we show the model accounts for up to 78% of the variance in moral norms and 88% in everyday etiquette across dozens of countries. Remarkably, the same societal tastes predict judgments on both profound moral issues, like euthanasia, and mundane behaviors, like singing on a bus. The model can even predict a country's entire landscape of norms without any prior norm data from that society. By establishing a high-performance, quantitative benchmark for norm prediction, the Moral Flavors Model provides a powerful new tool for computational social science and a parsimonious theory of cultural variation.",

          "Social media is recognized as an important source for deriving insights into public opinion dynamics and social impacts due to the vast textual data generated daily and the 'unconstrained' behavior of people interacting on these platforms. However, such analyses prove challenging due to the semantic shift phenomenon, where word meanings evolve over time. This paper proposes an unsupervised dynamic word embedding method to capture longitudinal semantic shifts in social media data without predefined anchor words. The method leverages word co-occurrence statistics and dynamic updating to adapt embeddings over time, addressing the challenges of data sparseness, imbalanced distributions, and synergistic semantic effects. Evaluated on a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset, the method reveals semantic evolution patterns of vaccine- and symptom-related entities across different pandemic stages, and their potential correlations with real-world statistics. Our key contributions include the dynamic embedding technique, empirical analysis of COVID-19 semantic shifts, and discussions on enhancing semantic shift modeling for computational social science research. This study enables capturing longitudinal semantic dynamics on social media to understand public discourse and collective phenomena.",
          "Most toxicity detection models treat toxicity as an intrinsic property of text, overlooking the role of context in shaping its impact. In this position paper, drawing on insights from psychology, neuroscience, and computational social science, we reconceptualise toxicity as a socially emergent signal of stress. We formalise this perspective in the Contextual Stress Framework (CSF), which defines toxicity as a stress-inducing norm violation within a given context and introduces an additional dimension for toxicity detection. As one possible realisation of CSF, we introduce PONOS (Proportion Of Negative Observed Sentiments), a metric that quantifies toxicity through collective social reception rather than lexical features. We validate this approach on a novel dataset, demonstrating improved contextual sensitivity and adaptability when used alongside existing models.",
          "Moral disengagement is a mechanism whereby people distance or disconnect their actions from their moral evaluation. This work presents a novel knowledge graph schema, dataset, and transformer-based NLP model to identify and represent indicators of moral disengagement in text. Our graph schema is informed by Albert Bandura’s psychosocial mechanisms of moral disengagement, including dehumanization, victimization, moral condemnation and justification, and attribution (or displacement) of responsibility. Our preliminary dataset is comprised of online posts from five different communities. We present initial evidence that (1) our theory-based schema can represent moral disengagement indicators across these communities and (2) our transformer-based NLP model can identify indicators of moral disengagement in text. As it matures, this thread of computational social science research can help us understand the spread of morally-disengaged language and its effect on online communities.",
          "This preprint introduces a formal model of affective-cognitive decision-making, applicable to a wide range of choice contexts (including moral, social, and political decisions), by representing affective forces as directional vectors embedded in a telotopic space. The framework extends sigmoid-based activation approaches by replacing scalar “drive vs inhibition” balances with an angular, alignment-sensitive calculus, enabling a finer representation of ambivalence, hesitation, and context-dependent reversals. The model defines conative (approach) and inhibitory (avoidance) components via magnitude and orientation relative to an effective telos, including the possibility of competing micro-teloi. A directionally weighted emotional score is then mapped through a sigmoid function to yield an action probability. This structure allows the diagnosis of cases where high-intensity forces remain behaviorally ineffective due to angular divergence, and supports simulations of classical moral dilemmas as well as extensions to collective dynamics through aggregation of affective vectors.

          "The digital traces generated by social media offer the opportunity to analyze human behavior at new scales, depths, and resolutions. The results of analyses of social media data, while sometimes difficult to generalize to a society as a whole, can give important insights on detailed actions and subjective states of individuals. This novel datasource offers a new window to tackle research questions from affective science with respect to emotion dynamics, collective emotions, and affective expression in social contexts. In this chapter, we present a balanced view of the benefits, risks, opportunities, and pitfalls of analyzing affective life through social media data. We review a variety of methods to quantify emotions and other affective states from social media data. We illustrate the application of these methods at new scales and resolutions in a series of examples from previous research. We present research gaps and open questions about the role, meaning, and functionality of affective expression in social media, pointing to emerging research trends in computational social science and social psychology. When used critically and with robust research methods, observational analyses of large-scale social media data can be complementary to traditional methodologies in psychology and cognitive science.",
          "The emergence of decentralized social media platforms presents new opportunities and challenges for real-time analysis of public discourse. This study introduces CognitiveSky, an open-source and scalable framework designed for sentiment, emotion, and narrative analysis on Bluesky, a federated Twitter or X.com alternative. By ingesting data through Bluesky's Application Programming Interface (API), CognitiveSky applies transformer-based models to annotate large-scale user-generated content and produces structured and analyzable outputs. These summaries drive a dynamic dashboard that visualizes evolving patterns in emotion, activity, and conversation topics. Built entirely on free-tier infrastructure, CognitiveSky achieves both low operational cost and high accessibility. While demonstrated here for monitoring mental health discourse, its modular design enables applications across domains such as disinformation detection, crisis response, and civic sentiment analysis. By bridging large language models with decentralized networks, CognitiveSky offers a transparent, extensible tool for computational social science in an era of shifting digital ecosystems."

          "The analysis of news dissemination is of utmost importance since the credibility of information and the identification of disinformation and misinformation affect society as a whole. Given the large amounts of news data published daily on the Web, the empirical analysis of news with regard to research questions and the detection of problematic news content on the Web require computational methods that work at scale. Today's online news are typically disseminated in a multimodal form, including various presentation modalities such as text, image, audio, and video. Recent developments in multimodal machine learning now make it possible to capture basic “descriptive” relations between modalities–such as correspondences between words and phrases, on the one hand, and corresponding visual depictions of the verbally expressed information on the other. Although such advances have enabled tremendous progress in tasks like image captioning, text-to-image generation and visual question answering, in domains such as news dissemination, there is a need to go further. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for the computational analysis of multimodal news. We motivate a set of more complex image-text relations as well as multimodal news values based on real examples of news reports and consider their realization by computational approaches. To this end, we provide (a) an overview of existing literature from semiotics where detailed proposals have been made for taxonomies covering diverse image-text relations generalisable to any domain; (b) an overview of computational work that derives models of image-text relations from data; and (c) an overview of a particular class of news-centric attributes developed in journalism studies called news values. The result is a novel framework for multimodal news analysis that closes existing gaps in previous work while maintaining and combining the strengths of those accounts. We assess and discuss the elements of the framework with real-world examples and use cases, setting out research directions at the intersection of multimodal learning, multimodal analytics and computational social sciences that can benefit from our approach.",

          "As visual content becomes increasingly prominent on social media, automated image categorization is vital for computational social science efforts to identify emerging visual themes and narratives in online debates. However, the methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently used in the field are unable to fully capture the connotative meaning of images, and struggle to produce easily interpretable clusters. In response to these challenges, we test an approach that leverages the ability of Vision-and-Large-Language-Models (VLLMs) to generate image descriptions that incorporate connotative interpretations of the input images. In particular, we use a VLLM to generate connotative textual descriptions of a set of images related to climate debate, and cluster the images based on these textual descriptions. In parallel, we cluster the same images using a more traditional approach based on CNNs. In doing so, we compare the connotative semantic validity of clusters generated using VLLMs with those produced using CNNs, and assess their interpretability. The results show that the approach based on VLLMs greatly improves the quality score for connotative clustering. Moreover, VLLM-based approaches, leveraging textual information as a step towards clustering, offer a high level of interpretability of the results.",

          "Recent research has shed light on the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across various general vision and language tasks. The performance of LMMs in specialized domains, such as social media, which integrates text, images, videos, and sometimes audio, remains an area of active interest. Effective analysis of such content requires models to interpret the complex interactions between different communication modalities and their influence on the conveyed message. This article explores GPT-4V(ision)’s performance in social multimedia analysis. We evaluate GPT-4V across five representative tasks: sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, fake news identification, demographic inference, and political ideology detection. Our approach includes a preliminary quantitative analysis for each task using existing benchmark datasets, followed by a review of the results and a selection of qualitative samples to demonstrate GPT-4V’s performance in multimodal social media content analysis. GPT-4V shows effectiveness in these tasks, exhibiting capabilities like joint image–text understanding, contextual and cultural awareness, and commonsense knowledge application. However, challenges persist, including struggles with multilingual social multimedia comprehension and difficulty in adapting to the latest social media trends. It also sometimes generates incorrect information about evolving knowledge of celebrities and politicians. This preliminary study aims to inform further research across disciplines, particularly in computational social science and social media studies. The findings highlight the potential of LMMs to enhance our understanding of social media content and its users through multimodal analysis.

          "Social media data enables political scientists to observe phenomena that have been otherwise difficult to capture. The scale and structure of such data is problematic, however, as sorting social media posts by hand is a prohibitively costly endeavor. For instance, there are over 500 million tweets posted per day, consisting of text, image, gif, and video content. This has created a technology gap between what social scientists want to do, conceptually, and what they can do, computationally. This study develops text- and multimodal (text and image) classification technology. Such methods are used to investigate questions in algorithmic bias, election experiences, and Black Lives Matter protest activity. Multiple machine learning algorithms -- called convolutional neural networks or textit{deep learning} models -- were developed. These models were trained on facial images and tweet text. Results indicate that deep learning achieves high accuracy on training data; performance declines when the machine attempts to predict the previously unseen validation set. These algorithms can lack predictive power. Deep learning shows promise for automated content analysis, but more work must be done to curate theoretically motivated training data. Social scientists should focus on features in the data that best differentiate categories of interest. This study contributes to larger trends in computational social science that seek to apply machine learning methods to problems in political science. Even the most advanced methodology, however, must be wrapped in strong theory and substantively interesting questions.",

          "Automated frame analysis of political communication is a popular task in computational social science that is used to study how authors select aspects of a topic to frame its reception. So far, such studies have been narrow, in that they use a fixed set of pre-defined frames and focus only on the text, ignoring the visual contexts in which those texts appear. Especially for framing in the news, this leaves out valuable information about editorial choices, which include not just the written article but also accompanying photographs. To overcome such limitations, we present a method for conducting multi-modal, multi-label framing analysis at scale using large (vision-) language models. Grounding our work in framing theory, we extract latent meaning embedded in images used to convey a certain point and contrast that to the text by comparing the respective frames used. We also identify highly partisan framing of topics with issue-specific frame analysis found in prior qualitative work. We demonstrate a method for doing scalable integrative framing analysis of both text and image in news, providing a more complete picture for understanding media bias.",

          "Point-of-interest (POI) type prediction is the task of inferring the type of a place from where a social media post was shared. Inferring a POI's type is useful for studies in computational social science including sociolinguistics, geosemiotics, and cultural geography, and has applications in geosocial networking technologies such as recommendation and visualization systems. Prior efforts in POI type prediction focus solely on text, without taking visual information into account. However in reality, the variety of modalities, as well as their semiotic relationships with one another, shape communication and interactions in social media. This paper presents a study on POI type prediction using multimodal information from text and images available at posting time. For that purpose, we enrich a currently available data set for POI type prediction with the images that accompany the text messages. Our proposed method extracts relevant information from each modality to effectively capture interactions between text and image achieving a macro F1 of 47.21 across eight categories significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art method for POI type prediction based on text-only methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis to shed light on cross-modal interactions and the limitations of our best performing model."

In this paper, we demonstrate how social media data from twitter can be used to predict the sales of iPhones. Based on a conceptual model of social data consisting of social graph (actors, actions, activities, and artefacts) and social text (topics, keywords, pronouns, and sentiments), we develop and evaluate a linear regression model that transforms iPhone tweets into a prediction of the quarterly iPhone sales with an average error close to the established prediction models from investment banks.

          "Systemic risk in global financial markets is increasingly shaped by the dynamics of information dissemination and media communication across interconnected platforms. With the rise of digital media, social networks, and algorithm-driven information environments, financial communication has become faster, more fragmented, and more complex, amplifying the potential for cross-market contagion. This review examines existing research on systemic risk from a communication-centered perspective, focusing on how information flows, media narratives, and networked communication structures influence risk transmission across stock, foreign exchange, and cryptocurrency markets. Drawing on studies from communication research, computational social science, and financial media analysis, the paper synthesizes theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches, including network analysis, sentiment analysis, and artificial intelligence–based models. The review highlights key patterns in information diffusion, media amplification, and audience interaction that contribute to market volatility and systemic vulnerability. By integrating insights from communication studies with computational methods, this review identifies current research gaps and proposes future directions for understanding systemic risk as a mediated and socially constructed phenomenon in global financial communication.",

          "Abstract Customer retention is crucial in a variety of businesses as acquiring new customers is often more costly than keeping the current ones. As a consequence, churn prediction has attracted great attention from both the business and academic worlds. Traditional efforts in the financial domain mainly focus on domain specific variables such as product ownership or service usage aggregation, however, without considering dynamic behavioral patterns of customers’ financial transactions. In this paper, we attempt to fill in this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal patterns and entropy of choices underlying the customers’ financial decisions, and their relations to customer churning activities. Inspired by previous works in the emerging field of computational social science, we built a prediction model based on spatio-temporal and choice behavioral traits using individual transaction records. Our results show that proposed dynamic behavioral models could predict churn decisions significantly better than traditionally considered factors such as demographic-based features, and that this effect remains consistent across multiple data sets and various churn definitions. We further study the relative importance of the various behavioral features in churn prediction, and how the predictive power varies across different demographic groups. More generally, the proposed features can also be applied to churn prediction in other domains where spatio-temporal behavioral data are available.",
          "Modeling the popularity dynamics of an online item is an important open problem in computational social science. This paper presents an in-depth study of popularity dynamics under external promotions, especially in predicting popularity jumps of online videos, and determining effective and efficient schedules to promote online content. The recently proposed Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) models popularity as a non-linear interplay between exogenous stimuli and the endogenous reactions. Here, we propose two novel metrics based on HIP: to describe popularity gain per unit of promotion, and to quantify the time it takes for such effects to unfold. We make increasingly accurate forecasts of future popularity by including information about the intrinsic properties of the video, promotions it receives, and the non-linear effects of popularity ranking. We illustrate by simulation the interplay between the unfolding of popularity over time, and the time-sensitive value of resources. Lastly, our model lends a novel explanation of the commonly adopted periodic and constant promotion strategy in advertising, as increasing the perceived viral potential. This study provides quantitative guidelines about setting promotion schedules considering content virality, timing, and economics.",
          "Recent research in the field of computational social science have shown how data resulting from the widespread adoption and use of social media channels such as twitter can be used to predict outcomes such as movie revenues, election winners, localized moods, and epidemic outbreaks. Underlying assumptions for this research stream on predictive analytics are that social media actions such as tweeting, liking, commenting and rating are proxies for user/consumer’s attention to a particular object/product and that the shared digital artefact that is persistent can create social influence. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media data from twitter and facebook can be used to predict the quarterly sales of iPhones and revenues of H&M respectively. Based on a conceptual model of social data consisting of social graph (actors, actions, activities, and artefacts) and social text (topics, keywords, pronouns, and sentiments), we develop and evaluate linear regression models that transform (a) iPhone tweets into a prediction of the quarterly iPhone sales with an average error close to the established prediction models from investment banks (Lassen, Madsen, & Vatrapu, 2014)and (b) facebook likes into a prediction of the global revenue of the fast fashion company, H&M. We discuss the findings and conclude with implications for predictive analytics with big social data.",

The movie is an essential cultural product and watching a movie is one of the most popular entertainment ways in our daily life. A favorite movie can attract the millions audience. Additionally, after years of development, the film industry has produced a large amount of data that can be supplied to the research about collective behavior propagation. Hence, movie industry is suitable candidate for investigating collective behavior propagation in social network. In this work, we construct a dataset including almost all the movies released in the United States from 1980 to 2017. By analyzing the US box office data, we found that \"action\", \"documentaries\" and \"drama\" are the most favorite movie genres in the past 38 years. We also find that the final total global gross of a movie is stronger related to its best weekly rank, namely, the global gross of the movie is almost proportional to its best weekly rank. Furthermore, we find that although the total box office is rising every year. However, with the birth of the Internet, fewer and fewer people are willing to go to the cinema to watch a movie. Our analysis can help understand how a movie become popular and help movie distributor to public audiences' taste and safety develop a plan for providing movie products.",
          "This paper tests whether accurate sales forecasts for Nike are possible from Facebook data and how events related to Nike affect the activity on Nike’s Facebook pages. The paper draws from the AIDA sales framework (Awareness, Interest, Desire,and Action) from the domain of marketing and employs the method of social set analysis from the domain of computational social science to model sales from Big Social Data. The dataset consists of (a) selection of Nike’s Facebook pages with the number of likes, comments, posts etc. that have been registered for each page per day and (b) business data in terms of quarterly global sales figures published in Nike’s financial reports. An event study is also conducted using the Social Set Visualizer (SoSeVi). The findings suggest that Facebook data does have informational value. Some of the simple regression models have a high forecasting accuracy. The multiple regressions have a lower forecasting accuracy and cause analysis barriers due to data set characteristics such as perfect multicollinearity. The event study found abnormal activity around several Nike specific events but inferences about those activity spikes, whether they are purely event-related or coincidences, can only be determined after detailed case-bycase text analysis. Our findings help assess the informational value of Big Social Data for a company’s marketing strategy, sales operations and supply chain.",
          "Blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) are reshaping global financial systems. Despite their impact, the spatial distribution of public sentiment and its economic and geopolitical determinants are often overlooked. This study analyzes over 150 million geo-tagged, DeFi-related tweets from 2012 to 2022, sourced from a larger dataset of 7.4 billion tweets. Using sentiment scores from a BERT-based multilingual classification model, we integrated these tweets with economic and geopolitical data to create a multimodal dataset. Employing techniques like sentiment analysis, spatial econometrics, clustering, and topic modeling, we uncovered significant global variations in DeFi engagement and sentiment. Our findings indicate that economic development significantly influences DeFi engagement, particularly after 2015. Geographically weighted regression analysis revealed GDP per capita as a key predictor of DeFi tweet proportions, with its impact growing following major increases in cryptocurrency values such as bitcoin. While wealthier nations are more actively engaged in DeFi discourse, the lowest-income countries often discuss DeFi in terms of financial security and sudden wealth. Conversely, middle-income countries relate DeFi to social and religious themes, whereas high-income countries view it mainly as a speculative instrument or entertainment. This research advances interdisciplinary studies in computational social science and finance and supports open science by making our dataset and code available on GitHub, and providing a non-code workflow on the KNIME platform. These contributions enable a broad range of scholars to explore DeFi adoption and sentiment, aiding policymakers, regulators, and developers in promoting financial inclusion and responsible DeFi engagement globally.",
          "Use of socially generated \"big data\" to access information about collective states of the minds in human societies has become a new paradigm in the emerging field of computational social science. A natural application of this would be the prediction of the society's reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adoption rate. However, bridging the gap between \"real time monitoring\" and \"early predicting\" remains a big challenge. Here we report on an endeavor to build a minimalistic predictive model for the financial success of movies based on collective activity data of online users. We show that the popularity of a movie can be predicted much before its release by measuring and analyzing the activity level of editors and viewers of the corresponding entry to the movie in Wikipedia, the well-known online encyclopedia.",

          "Over the past decade, the use of social media (SM) such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr has dramatically increased. Using SM, millions of users are creating large amounts of data every day. According to some estimates ninety per cent of the content on the Internet is now user generated. Social Media (SM) can be seen as a distributed content creation and sharing platform based on Web 2.0 technologies. SM sites make it very easy for its users to publish text, pictures, links, messages or videos without the need to be able to program. Users post reviews on products and services they bought, write about their interests and intentions or give their opinions and views on political subjects. SM has also been a key factor in mass movements such as the Arab Spring and the Occupy Wall Street protests and is used for human aid and disaster relief (HADR). There is a growing interest in SM analysis from organisations for detecting new trends, getting user opinions on their products and services or finding out about their online reputation. Companies such as Amazon or eBay use SM data for their recommendation engines and to generate more business. TV stations buy data about opinions on their TV programs from Facebook to find out what the popularity of a certain TV show is. Companies such as Topsy, Gnip, DataSift and Zoomph have built their entire business models around SM analysis. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the economic value of Twitter tweets. The economic value is determined by trying to predict the share price of a company. If the share price of a company can be predicted using SM data, it should be possible to deduce a monetary value. There is limited research on determining the economic value of SM data for “nowcasting”, predicting the present, and for forecasting. This study aims to determine the monetary value of Twitter by correlating the daily frequencies of positive and negative Tweets about the Apple company and some of its most popular products with the development of the Apple Inc. share price. If the number of positive tweets about Apple increases and the share price follows this development, the tweets have predictive information about the share price. A literature review has found that there is a growing interest in analysing SM data from different industries. A lot of research is conducted studying SM from various perspectives. Many studies try to determine the impact of online marketing campaigns or try to quantify the value of social capital. Others, in the area of behavioural economics, focus on the influence of SM on decision-making. There are studies trying to predict financial indicators such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). However, the literature review has indicated that there is no study correlating sentiment polarity on products and companies in tweets with the share price of the company. The theoretical framework used in this study is based on Computational Social Science (CSS) and Big Data. Supporting theories of CSS are Social Media Mining (SMM) and sentiment analysis. Supporting theories of Big Data are Data Mining (DM) and Predictive Analysis (PA). Machine learning (ML) techniques have been adopted to analyse and classify the tweets. In the first stage of the study, a body of tweets was collected and pre-processed, and then analysed for their sentiment polarity towards Apple Inc., the iPad and the iPhone. Several datasets were created using different pre-processing and analysis methods. The tweet frequencies were then represented as time series. The time series were analysed against the share price time series using the Granger causality test to determine if one time series has predictive information about the share price time series over the same period of time. For this study, several Predictive Analytics (PA) techniques on tweets were evaluated to predict the Apple share price. To collect and analyse the data, a framework has been developed based on the LingPipe (LingPipe 2015) Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool kit for sentiment analysis, and using R, the functional language and environment for statistical computing, for correlation analysis. Twitter provides an API (Application Programming Interface) to access and collect its data programmatically. Whereas no clear correlation could be determined, at least one dataset was showed to have some predictive information on the development of the Apple share price. The other datasets did not show to have any predictive capabilities. There are many data analysis and PA techniques. The techniques applied in this study did not indicate a direct correlation. However, some results suggest that this is due to noise or asymmetric distributions in the datasets. The study contributes to the literature by providing a quantitative analysis of SM data, for example tweets about Apple and its most popular products, the iPad and iPhone. It shows how SM data can be used for PA. It contributes to the literature on Big Data and SMM by showing how SM data can be collected, analysed and classified and explore if the share price of a company can be determined based on sentiment time series. It may ultimately lead to better decision making, for instance for investments or share buyback.",

          "Abstract : On October 26th and 27th, 2010, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) organized an interdisciplinary workshop in which participants from a range of institutions and research backgrounds presented and discussed papers on a range of topics related to the development and use of computational social science (CSS) in national security decision-making. Computational social science refers to the use of computational modeling and simulation approaches, including agent-based, social network, discrete event, and systems dynamics methodologies, to study behavioral, cultural, and social dynamics. CSS has long roots in computer science, artificial intelligence, and quantitative social science. Over the past decade, CSS methods have captured the attention of the national security community as a source of analytic and decision-support technologies for a range of challenges, from counterinsurgency to terrorism. The first phase of this project was a comparative, interdisciplinary review of literature related to applied computational modeling and simulation in both the social and physical sciences; this study is described in a summary paper that McNamara and Trucano authored (Appendix A). The workshop participants reviewed the work by McNamara and Trucano in light of their own research and work experiences. Our participants included social, computational, and physical scientists from a range of government, industry, and academic institutions. Most, but not all, had also participated in projects to develop and deploy computational models and simulations of social phenomena for decision-making; and over half the participants had worked on computational modeling and simulation projects in national security contexts.",
          "Abstract In recent decades, researchers have analyzed professional military education (PME) organizations to understand the characteristics and transformation of the core of military culture, the officer corps. Several historical studies have demonstrated the potential of this approach, but they were limited by both theoretical and methodological hurdles. This paper presents a new historical-institutionalist framework for analyzing officership and PME, integrating computational social science methods for large-scale data collection and analysis to overcome limited access to military environments and the intensive manual labor required for data collection and analysis. Furthermore, in an era where direct demographic data are increasingly being removed from the public domain, our indirect estimation methods provide one of the few viable alternatives for tracking institutional change. This approach will be demonstrated using web-scraping and a quantitative text analysis of the entire repository of theses from an elite American military school.",
          "Being empowered with the appropriate toolset will enable decision-makers to analyze how best to intervene in ever-changing complex systems. This research project explored deconstructing qualitative methods to identify and document requirements to connect the models to computational social science approaches. Previous efforts from our research provided a customizable toolset that assesses the current and future impact that decisions, policies, or strategies can deliver in a system to tackle particularly complex problems. This paper presents a portion of the research effort that developed a threat analysis framework by establishing formally documented research methods to effectively combine conceptual and computational tools. This enables more accurate, efficient, and foresightful knowledge capture and depictions of a particular problem space. The case that the tools and approach are tested against is Russia's application of grey zone warfare tools in Moldova.",
          "ABSTRACTABSTRACTWe introduce a method to measure the socially constituted strength of an insurgency and its state opponent as they compete for recognition as a governing body, based upon the four flows theory of the communicative constitution of organizations. We validate our method using a RAND data set of 30 recently concluded insurgencies, and find that our method not only predicts the ultimate victor in all 30 conflicts, but also refines previous analyses of the pattern of conflict by reducing the number of parameters necessary to forecast outcomes and grounding these observed trends in the intersection of organization and communication theories. Our results reveal the criticality of an organization maintaining an aura of cohesive structuring while avoiding to appear more oppressive than its opponent.KEYWORDS: Asymmetric conflictinsurgencysocial movementcommunicative constitution of organizations (CCO)computational social science Disclosure statementThe authors report there are no competing interests to declare.Additional informationNotes on contributorsKyle M.

          "Deterrence is an ancient strategy (as early as the 4th millennium BCE) based on defence and retaliation to prevent undesirable behaviour from a potential attacker. Specifically, deterrence&amp;mdash;both classical and cyber-related&amp;mdash;is based on a potential attacker perceiving an unacceptable cost and consequently refraining from attack. Similarly to nuclear deterrence, cyber-deterrence may be an effective strategy against foreign governmental attackers, who might refrain from attacking for fear of retaliation. However, cyber-deterrence may not be as effective against individual terrorist hackers or clandestine organisations that have a high propensity towards risks or simply believe they can attack with impunity. This paper outlines some solutions to the fundamental challenge of modelling deterrence in Cyberia and discusses theoretical and policy implications based on computational social science.",

          "DARPA initiated a six-month Pre-Conflict Anticipation and Shaping (PCAS) initiative to demonstrate the utility of quantitative and computational social science models (Q/CSS) applied to assessing the instability and failure of nation-states. In this program ten different teams of Q/CSS researchers and practitioners developed nation state instability models and then applied them to two different countries to assess their current stability levels as well as forecast their stability levels 6-12 months hence. The models developed ranged from systems dynamics, structural equations, cellular automata, Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models, scale-invariant geo-political distributions, and multi agent-based systems. In the PCAS program we also explored a mechanism for sensitivity analysis of Q/CSS model results to selected parameters, and we also implemented a mechanism to automatically categorize, parse, extract and auto-populate a bank of Q/CSS models from large-scale open source text streams. Preliminary yet promising results were achieved, and the utility of the results can provide added value for decision-making problems around planning, intelligence analysis, information operations and training. This paper describes the motivation and rationale for the program, the Q/CSS models and mechanisms, and presents results from some of the models. In addition, future research and key challenges in using these Q/CSS models within an operational decision making environment will be discussed",
          "Military planners and other decision makers require advanced early warning of impending crises so they can devise effective mitigation plans, mobilize resources, and coordinate responses with their foreign counterparts. Over the last 40 years, the US government has invested generously in several attempts to build crisis forecasting systems that were analytically defensible and capable of processing and making sense of vast amounts of information in real or near real time. This article describes the most recent attempt by the US military to develop an Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS). Although ICEWS relies heavily on social science theories, data, and methods, our experiences thus far reveal some strengths and limitations of contemporary quantitative approaches to addressing social science questions with real world implications. The article concludes with a sketch of a new paradigmatic approach—a Computational Social Science Experimentation Proving Ground—that could not only improve crisis early warning and response, but also revolutionize how social science knowledge is developed, evaluated, and applied more broadly.",

          "The military missions referred to as irregular warfare, which include counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and stability operations, share the essential tenet of influence over populations. Within the defense analysis community, a new emphasis on such influence has been realized simultaneously with the emergence of the field of computational social science. This intersection of urgent requirement and nascent capability has resulted in new simulation models being rushed into service. In some instances these complex simulations are employed without empirical knowledge of their behaviors. This thesis examines one such model, Nexus Schema Learner and its performance, over a large number of replications. Several input parameters of the Nexus model are explored through experiments. The propagation of uncertainty in these parameters to the output of the model is examined. The results of Nexus are also compared to a very simple model of a single social theory. The research provides perspectives, techniques, and measures important to the practical application of Nexus. Influential parameters and associated broad categories of behavior are identified. These behaviors are also compared to the simple model. The findings provide an opportunity to consider empirical results of the simulation against its intended use and the social theories it is purports to represent. Additional areas for conceptual, technical, and analytical development are outlined, pursuit of which will make future simulation studies using Nexus Schema Learner more effective and efficient. Some of these results provide compelling lessons for developers and potential users of all types of computational social science models.",

          "The introductory course in basics of programming aims to teach second-year political science students the basic skills of applied programming that are crucial for transferring their research ideas into computational models. As one of students' first interactions with computer science concepts, the course assists in overcoming their barriers in programming, and introduces them to ways of applying computational thinking. In addition, the course material can serve as a launching pad for further development in the areas of modelling social problems, its simulations and quantitative analysis. This paper presents course design considerations, shares findings in assignment design, and raises questions to consider when designing CS0 and CS1 courses for social science students.",
          "In recent years, social scientists with data science skills have gained positions in academic and non-academic organizations as computational social scientists who blend skillsets from data science and social science. Yet as this trend is relatively new in the social sciences, navigating these emerging and diverse career paths remains ambiguous. We formalize this hidden curriculum by providing a step-by-step guide to graduate students based on our collective experiences as computational social scientists working in academic, public, and private sector organizations. Specifically, we break down the computational social science (CSS) professionalization process into three steps: (1) learning data science skills; (2) building a portfolio that focuses on using data science to answer social science questions; and (3) connecting with other computational social scientists. For each step, we identify and elaborate on core competencies and additional useful skills that are specific to the academic and non-academic job markets. Although this article is not exhaustive, it provides a much-needed guide for graduate students, as well as their faculty advisors and departments, to navigate the growing field of computational social science. By sharing this guide, we hope to help make computational social science professionalization more systematic and accessible.",
          "ABSTRACT Social scientists with data science skills increasingly are assuming positions as computational social scientists in academic and non-academic organizations. However, because computational social science (CSS) is still relatively new to the social sciences, it can feel like a hidden curriculum for many PhD students. To support social science PhD students, this article is an accessible guide to CSS training based on previous literature and our collective working experiences in academic, public-, and private-sector organizations. We contend that students should supplement their traditional social science training in research design and domain expertise with CSS training by focusing on three core areas: (1) learning data science skills, (2) building a portfolio that uses data science to answer social science questions, and (3) connecting with computational social scientists. We conclude with practical recommendations for departments and professional associations to better support PhD students.",
          "CS0 and CS1 courses are becoming an essential part of many social science programs, including sociology and political science. This particular assignment was designed as part of the 'Basics of Programming in Python' course for undergraduate political science students. The course aims not only to prepare students for the unified programming exam, but also to apply concepts of computational thinking in the context of political science problems. By linking these fields, students learn to overcome inner barriers in coding and explore the potential of computational social science methods for both academic path and career.",

CSS is an emerging discipline that integrates data science methods with social science theories and research designs. However, undergraduate social science students could face a lack of a sense of STEM identity or belonging. Also, compared to STEM majors in natural science or engineering, average undergraduate social science students come in with limited mathematical or statistical knowledge. The OERs developed and tested in this article are designed with pedagogical frameworks that help overcome these barriers faced by students from diverse backgrounds and offer students a jump-start in learning CSS.

          "Data education is gaining traction across disciplines and degree levels in higher education. Teaching data skills in the Social Sciences in today's data-driven world is vital for preparing the next generation of data literate and critical social scientists. The ability to identify, assess, analyze, and communicate well and responsibly with data is key for scholars and professionals to navigate dynamic and expansive information ecosystems. This paradigm shift demands instructors to adapt their curricula and pedagogy to advance students’ computational and statistical knowledge. This paper presents some of the findings from a local report of a larger national project which explored pedagogical techniques and instructional support needs for teaching undergraduates with quantitative data in the Social Sciences. Results revealed that the core learning goal of instructors is to develop students' critical thinking skills with data, including the conceptual understanding of the research methods employed in the field; the ability to critically evaluate research methodologies, findings, and data sets; and prowess using quantitative and computational tools and technologies. A recurring theme across interviews was students’ fear of math and technology and challenges these fears pose to data-related instruction. Instructors value participation in a community of practice and are eager for more institutional support to advance their computational skills. Based on these findings, we suggest avenues for academic libraries to further develop services, activities, and partnerships to aid data instruction efforts in the Social Sciences.",
          "Universities are increasingly interested in providing courses that equip students with data science skills and engage experiential learning, particularly in the social sciences. However, these courses can be costly to implement and time-consuming for instructors to develop. This article describes an integrative learning model for teaching computational social science skills to undergraduate students. There are three elements to the model: content delivery through collaborative learning, skill development in an applied lab setting, and student mentorship. I apply this model to an experiential course where undergraduate students learn to create and conduct a national public opinion poll. The model addresses the need for university classes that equip undergraduate students with computational social science skills, and provides a pathway for training student researchers as teaching assistants for future courses. This model builds the research capacity of faculty, graduate assistants, and undergraduates, invests in data science by providing an infrastructure for the collection of large scale data over time, and integrates experiences inside and outside of the classroom. This model is replicable at other institutions and will be of benefit to programs seeking to implement best practices and maximize learning effectiveness through research integration."

          "In many areas of law, legal concepts are characterised by a having degree of fuzziness, which leads to “matters of degree” assessment when such concepts are applied in legal practice. In this paper, we examine how this fuzziness may be mapped and understood. We approach this problem through an abductive inspired discovery approach. Specifically, we show how LLMs can be employed to understand how decision-makers make inferences about applicants’ credibility in asylum cases and to capture indicators attached to such evidence assessments - an issue surrounded by significant disagreement in both legal scholarship and legal practice. We do this through a two-step methodology that recognizes the uncertainties surrounding LLMs and attempts to purposefully utilize the breadth of learned representations embedded in the model. Step one uses open-ended prompting to identify credibility indicators on a sample from our dataset; step two synthesizes these discoveries into generalizable categories and applies them to the full dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that LLMs can successfully identify credibility factors that correspond to established legal understanding of credibility’s role as evidence while revealing how these abstract principles translate to more a variety of credibility indicators in applied practice. Our scaled analysis across the full dataset reveals the relative frequency and importance of different credibility indicators in Danish asylum practice. This methodology advances both legal scholarship and computational social science by offering an approach to analyzing multi-variable and open-ended legal concepts at a greater scale. Our abductive inspired framework provides a systematic approach for empirically grounding theoretical understandings of fuzzy legal concepts, bridging the gap between abstract evidence law and actual decision-making practice in a way that is broadly applicable in law as well as other social science domains.",

          "In October 2015, the government of Chile started a constitution-making process, which allowed citizen participation. During the participatory phase, citizens gathered in local selfconvoked encounters to debate on four dimensions: constitutional values, rights, duties, and institutions. For each one of these four dimensions, participants collectively selected seven concepts from a list provided by the government or added new ones. For each concept, they wrote down a short argument explaining why this concept should be included in the new constitution. Although this process did not result in a new Constitution, the citizen consultation resulted in a valuable and unique source of information about people’s social and political preferences. The first objective of this work is related to the constitutional process itself and the citizen participation. The Chilean process exhibited two critical design weaknesses we analyze here. The first one is representativeness: the voluntary nature of the encounters increased participation biases, as those citizens who support the acting government were more likely to participate in the consultation. We study the determining factors of citizen participation in ELAs by setting up various regression models at the municipality-level. We found that engagement in politics and support for the government increases participation, which suggests that citizen involvement in the constitutional process may have been ideologically driven. The second weakness is the group deliberation quality. For a public deliberation to produce epistemic superiority, all the participants should have access to relevant and accurate information and evidence. Then, we analyze the written arguments for each selected concept, using structural topic modeling and natural language processing. We show that the emergent content can be ideologically differentiated, and that groups from municipalities with higher socioeconomic index, on average, produce higher-quality deliberation compared to groups from less developed municipalities. The second object of study comes from the data. The dataset gathered in the local participatory phase provides a rich source of information about people’s political preferences. To map the political ideology, we built co-occurrence networks where the nodes represent the constitutional concepts, and the links represent the association among them. Then, we aim to discover the structure of the ideology by examining the resulting networks, and identifying clusters - highly connected groups of concepts - inside them. The communities we found are consistent with the political conglomerates existing in Chile in 2016. Finally, using natural language processing techniques, we extracted psycho-linguistic features from the argument texts. These features are “internal factors”, for they respond to the intrinsic psychological, emotional, attitudinal or cognitive state of the subject, which affects their political ideology. Next, we set up a discrete choice model to study the effect of those features in cluster membership. We find that the progressive-left cluster shows a more propositive and non-agentic attitude when referring to values, as opposed to the traditional left. Regarding the dimension of rights, the right-wing cluster displays a more valorative attitude, suggesting that first-generation rights may also play the role of values. Throughout all chapters, and by the methods we use, this work attempts to contribute to the field of computational social science",
          "Background: The Federalist Society, a leading conservative legal organization, has played a significant role in shaping the American judiciary for decades.

          "Scholars have long questioned whether and how courts influence society. We contribute to this debate by investigating the ability of judicial decisions to shape issue attention and affect toward courts in media serving the LGBTQ+ community. To do so, we compiled an original database of LGBTQ+ magazine coverage of court cases over an extended period covering major decisions, including Lawrence v. Texas (2003), Goodridge v. Massachusetts Department of Public Health (2003), and Lofton v. Secretary of Department of Children &amp; Family Services (2004). We argue these cases influence the volume and tone of LGBTQ+ media coverage. Combining computational social science techniques with qualitative analysis, we find increased attention to same-sex marriage after the decisions in Lawrence , Goodridge , and Lofton, and the coalescence of discussions of courts around same-sex marriage after Lawrence. We also show how LGBTQ+ media informed readers about the political and legal implications of struggles over marriage equality.",
          "Political institutions and the policies they create are central to modern societies, and have a strong influence on many aspects of everyday life. Lawmaking more specifically describes the process of creating and adapting such policies by drafting legislation. This process takes place in a country’s legislature, in which elected officials –representatives – come together to debate policies. This thesis explores the process of lawmaking in U.S. Congress. Using state-of-the-art text analysis methods, it ex-amines the transcripts of the floor speeches of representatives in order to understand this process from a substantive perspective. By extracting relevant information from the available textual data, it explores the discursive dynamics in U.S. Congress, how the topics which representatives talk about can contribute to polarization, and how the representatives’ speech patterns predict their voting behavior. This thesis is motivated by a desire to understand not just what policy changes are made by the U.S. legislature, but also why and through which processes. By combining political speech with vote results data, it aims to understand which mechanisms drive the policy outcomes that we observe. It aims to not just deepen our understanding of how the representatives in the two chambers of Congress have voted, but why. What influence do their social origins play, their education and occupational history? What role do the institutions in Congress – the committees, the whips, the parties – play in these decisions? How can we explain the large shift in economic policy that took place in the second half of the 20th century? To answer these questions and contribute to a deeper understanding of the lawmaking processes in U.S. Congress, this thesis operates under the framework of analytical sociology. It designs testable hypotheses about how lawmaking happens at various points in time. In total, the thesis explores more than 130 years of Congressional lawmaking and examines over 17 million speeches by more than 7,000 representatives, and over 100,000 roll-call votes. To enable such a large-scale analysis of text and vote data, the thesis draws on the toolkit of computational social science to ex-tract signal from the large amounts of data this thesis tackles. More specifically, it draws on recent advances in text analysis methods, including Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract relevant information from text that can give us insight into the preferences and motivations of the representatives. Across three essays, this dissertation analyses the reasoning of representatives and how policy changes over time. The first essay examines the discursive dynamics in U.S. Congress around a time when the U.S. economic system underwent exogenous shocks. It determines how the shared experiences of representatives and the institutional setting in which they operate influenced their policy preferences. The second essay explores polarization in Congress based on what topics representatives talk about, highlighting that party polarization is only one aspect of the diverging trends we observe in Congress. The third essay proceeds to explore the relevancy of the contents of floor speeches for the representatives’ voting behavior. The essay predicts the likelihood of representatives breaking ranks with their party in roll-call votes based on their speeches in advance of the vote. It uses this information to derive a measure of party pressure, highlighting how the institutional context of Congress restricts lawmakers in their choices, but unevenly so over time. This thesis contributes to, and draws upon, a large amount of literature in sociology, political science, and computational linguistics. It uses modelling frameworks developed by political science to analyze the lawmaking process, develops hypotheses based on an analytical sociological perspective on social change, and adapts three different computational text analysis methods to align with the theoretical and methodological assumptions and preconditions of its work.",

          "Software repositories provide a detailed record of software evolution by capturing developer interactions through code-related activities such as pull requests and modifications. To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability.

          "A complete declarative description of the computational environment is often missing when researchers share their materials. Without such description, software obsolescence and missing system components can jeopardize computational reproducibility in the future, even when data and computer code are available. The R package rang is a complete solution for generating the declarative description for other researchers to automatically reconstruct the computational environment at a specific time point. The reconstruction process, based on Docker, has been tested for R code as old as 2001. The declarative description generated by rang satisfies the definition of a reproducible research compendium and can be shared as such. In this contribution, we show how rang can be used to make otherwise unexecutable code, spanning from fields such as computational social science and bioinformatics, executable again. We also provide instructions on how to use rang to construct reproducible and shareable research compendia of current research.

          "Abstract Data from software repositories have become an important foundation for the empirical study of software engineering processes. A recurring theme in the repository mining literature is the inference of developer networks capturing e.g. collaboration, coordination, or communication from the commit history of projects. Many works in this area studied networks of co-authorship of software artefacts, neglecting detailed information on code changes and code ownership available in software repositories. To address this issue, we introduce , a scalable software that facilitates the extraction of fine-grained co-editing networks in large repositories. It uses text mining techniques to analyse the detailed history of textual modifications within files. We apply our tool in two case studies using repositories of multiple Open Source as well as a proprietary software project. Specifically, we use data on more than 1.2 million commits and more than 25,000 developers to test a hypothesis on the relation between developer productivity and co-editing patterns in software teams. We argue that opens up an important new source of high-resolution data on human collaboration patterns that can be used to advance theory in empirical software engineering, computational social science, and organisational studies.",
          "This dataset provides an auditable, full-coverage, and lossless multi-level knowledge graph derived from a structured machine-learning methodology document (V12). The graph preserves 100% of the source document’s atomic units—paragraph text units and table cells (including empty units)—to support deterministic coverage auditing, traceability, and reproducible governance workflows. It is delivered as a CSV-formatted graph with explicit `NODE` and `EDGE` records, including hierarchical levels (document → sections → paragraphs/tables → rows → atomic text units) and derived semantic layers (formulas, rules/procedures, algorithm modules, and tokens). Each atomic node is indexed (e.g., `paragraph_index`, `table_index`, `row_index`, `col_index`) to enable exact structural reconstruction and machine-verifiable integrity checks. Beyond documentation preservation, the dataset is directly usable for machine-learning solution design and machine-learning research auditing. For solution design, the graph functions as a computable blueprint of ML workflow components (objective functions, diagnostics, threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, MRB reproducibility fields, robustness/fairness evidence) that can be queried and assembled into implementation-ready checklists or pipeline specifications. For research auditing, it supports evidence-based review of methodological completeness and compliance (e.g., reproducibility package requirements, deterministic hashing rules, stable sorting, adaptive floating-point quantization, environment locking), enabling structured verification of whether a reported ML study meets auditable standards. The dataset is suitable for ML engineering teams, research evaluators, governance/compliance units, and computational social science or AI governance researchers, and can be imported into graph databases or processed in Python/R for automated checks, benchmarking, and reporting.",

          "Innovation processes are critical for preserving and improving our standard of living. While innovation has been studied by many disciplines, the focus has been on qualitative measures that are specific to a single technological domain. I adopt a quantitative approach to investigate underlying regularities that generalize across multiple domains. I use a novel approach to better understand the innovation process by combining computational models with empirical data on software development, on one hand, and the evolution of the English lexicon on the other. Innovation can be viewed as the recombination and mutation of existing building blocks. I focus on how building blocks are used to generate innovations. The building blocks are pieces of code (e.g., functions or objects) for the software development data and words for the written language. These data lie at extremes of time scales: innovation occurring over the course of a few days or a week in the case of software while language evolution occurs over decades or centuries. This allows the examination of innovation processes that range from highly-constrained to completely open-ended. Computational methods reinforce the findings from the data analyses and permit exploration of the general features of innovation processes through the construction of abstract models.",

          "This paper describes an approach integrating cognitive engineering with computational social science in the context of open source software (OSS) development. Through an analysis of large-scale collaborations in a complex operational setting, we study how expertise and task complexity predict changes in productivity when knowledge loss occurs. Using team data from thousands of software files, we model the effects of expertise, complexity, and knowledge loss on productivity. On its own, knowledge loss had a negative effect on productivity, but this effect was reversed when knowledge loss was combined with high complexity and high numbers of newcomers, suggesting that experts are better able to utilize crowdsourced work. We identify opportunities for research to inform prediction of outcomes in OSS projects based on team and task characteristics and demonstrate the value of integrating cognitive engineering with computational social science to study collaborative work in sociotechnical systems.",

          "Robust digital experimentation platforms have become increasingly pervasive at major technology and e-commerce firms worldwide. They allow product managers to use data-driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this Issues and Opinions article is to shed light on OTPs—in our experience, most researchers are unaware of how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We used a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments meant to serve a different purpose is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge.",
          "The future for science gateways warrants exploration as we consider the possibilities that extend well beyond ’science’ and high-performance computing into new interfaces, applications and user communities. In this paper, we look retrospectively at the successes of representative gateways thus far. This serves to highlight existing gaps gateways need to overcome in areas such as accessibility, usability and interoperability, and in the need for broader outreach by drawing insights from technology adoption research. We explore two particularly promising opportunities for gateways - computational social sciences and virtual reality – and make the case for the gateway community to be more intentional in engaging with users to encourage adoption and implementation, especially in the area of educational usage. We conclude with a call for focused attention on legal hurdles in order to realize the full future potential of science gateways.

          "The revolution of ICT technologies in Digital Era combined with progress of ComplexitySciences have lead to the emergence of Computational Social Science, whose purposeis to analyze society in a quantitative way. Physics, can provide some tools in suchendeavor. Here, a new experimental framework called Pop-Up Experiments, based in Citizen Science philosophy and scientic rigor of Behavioral Experiments, is proposed.Experiments and mathematical models, in agreement with them, are used to validate and explain stylized facts of social phenomena concerning three diferent areas regarding human decision-making: Social Dilemmas, Pedestrian Movement and Financial Markets. In first place, two experiments are carried out on a variety of Social Dilemmas. Results demonstrate that children present a more volatile and random behavior than adults and the fact that individuals can be assigned to a small number of behavioral phenotypes. Secondly, pedestrian movement of visitors in a out-door fair have also been empiricallystudied. A model based in Langevin Dynamics that includes orientation persistence andpotential landscape is able to reproduce observed movement patterns. Moreover, suchtested model is theoretically adapted for describing other related issues like searching patterns. Finally, an experiment on human behavior with nancial data, where participants try to anticipate real price series, reveals that under high uncertain environment humans develop intuitive strategies that ease them to make decisions. One of such found strategies consist in imitating what the price did before. The existence of such strategyin real financial Big Data recordings is tested and afterwards confirmed by using Mutual Information and Transfer of Entropy techniques. Those mathematical methods also constitute a powerful tool to analyze the behavior of a population of investors in terms of synchronization and anticipation. In summary, all these experiences demonstrate thatstochastic models and mathematical tools belonging to Physics combined with Pop-UpExperiments constitute a very powerful tool at the service of Computational Social Science for the study of human decision-making. The impact of such fact based approachmodels is can be important in promoting cooperative environments in educational process, redesigning spaces to allow a better mobility in areas like fairs or understanding how people manage their investments to establish better financial market policies.",

They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.",
          "The rapid growth of social media platforms has radically changed the dynamics by which artistic content is disseminated, enabling the development of new paradigms for artistic production and audience engagement. This study undertakes an in-depth examination and visualization framework aimed at explicating the spread of artistic content on major social media platforms. By consolidating and analyzing data from Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Pinterest, and Behance, this study examines 500,000 art-related posts over a 12-month period to identify key dissemination patterns and viral dynamics. The methodological framework utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks for extracting visual features and graph-based approaches for modeling diffusion dynamics, supplemented by advanced visualization techniques to explain complex dynamics of dissemination. Findings reveal that the spread of artistic content follows certain temporal and spatial dynamics, with the visual appeal of an artwork, posting times, and network effects constituting key drivers of virality. The visualization framework utilized integrates interactive network graphs, temporal heat maps, and multi-dimensional scaling to represent dissemination pathways, thus enabling real-time tracking and pattern detection. The predictive models achieve an accuracy level of 87.3% in predicting the viral potential, reflecting a significant performance boost compared to conventional baseline techniques. This study offers novel insights into digital art consumption, provides actionable suggestions for artists and cultural institutions, and establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding the diffusion of creative content in interconnected systems. The proposed framework has practical implications in terms of how content can be optimized, audience engagement enhanced, and platform design improved, effectively bridging the gap between computational social science and problems relevant to digital humanities.",
          "The study of virality and information diffusion online is a topic gaining traction rapidly in the computational social sciences. Computer vision and social network analysis research have also focused on understanding the impact of content and information diffusion in making content viral, with prior approaches not performing significantly well as other traditional classification tasks. In this paper, we present a novel pairwise reformulation of the virality prediction problem as an attribute prediction task and develop a novel algorithm to model image virality on online media using a pairwise neural network. Our model provides significant insights into the features that are responsible for promoting virality and surpasses the existing state-of-the-art by a 12% average improvement in prediction. We also investigate the effect of external category supervision on relative attribute prediction and observe an increase in prediction accuracy for the same across several attribute learning datasets.",

          "Quantitative analysis of internet memes—digital cultural phenomena that propagate through online networks—remains an understudied domain in computational social science. Building upon established research that modeled meme popularity through ordinary differential equations, this study presents a novel machine learning approach to classify and predict meme popularity trajectories. Previous work identified four distinct post-peak patterns: smooth decay, oscillatory decay, plateau, and sustained growth. We significantly expanded the empirical foundation by constructing a comprehensive dataset of 2000+ memes, leveraging Google Trends time-series data. Our methodological framework employed a two-stage machine learning pipeline: first, implementing k-means clustering ($ k = 4 $) for unsupervised pattern discovery, followed by support vector classification for supervised learning. This approach enabled both validation of previously identified trajectory patterns and development of a predictive model for meme popularity evolution. Additionally, we conducted a systematic analysis of the relationship between meme taxonomic categories (e.g., catchphrases, viral videos) and their temporal popularity patterns. Our findings contribute to the emerging field of computational memetics and offer insights into the quantitative dynamics of online cultural transmission. The resulting classification model demonstrates robust predictive capabilities, with implications for understanding viral content dynamics in digital ecosystems.",

          "Social media provide a wealth of information for research into public health by providing a rich mix of personal data, location, hashtags, and social network information. Among these, Instagram has been recently the subject of many computational social science studies. However despite Instagram's focus on image sharing, most studies have exclusively focused on the hashtag and social network structure. In this paper we perform the first large scale content analysis of Instagram posts, addressing both the image and the associated hashtags, aiming to understand the content of partially-labelled images taken in-the-wild and the relationship with hashtags that individuals use as noisy labels. In particular, we explore the possibility of learning to recognise food image content in a data driven way, discovering both the categories of food, and how to recognise them, purely from social network data. Notably, we demonstrate that our approach to food recognition can often achieve accuracies greater than 70% in recognising popular food-related image categories, despite using no manual annotation. We highlight the current capabilities and future challenges and opportunities for such data-driven analysis of image content and the relation to hashtags.",

          "The analysis of the creation, mutation, and propagation of social media content on the Internet is an essential problem in computational social science, affecting areas ranging from marketing to political mobilization. A first step towards understanding the evolution of images online is the analysis of rapidly modifying and propagating memetic imagery or `memes'. However, a pitfall in proceeding with such an investigation is the current incapability to produce a robust semantic space for such imagery, capable of understanding differences in Image Macros. In this study, we provide a first step in the systematic study of image evolution on the Internet, by proposing an algorithm based on sparse representations and deep learning to decouple various types of content in such images and produce a rich semantic embedding. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a variety of tasks pertaining to memes and Image Macros, such as image clustering, image retrieval, topic prediction and virality prediction, surpassing the existing methods on each. In addition to its utility on quantitative tasks, our method opens up the possibility of obtaining the first large-scale understanding of the evolution and propagation of memetic imagery.",

          "Our global population contributes visual content on platforms like Instagram, attempting to express themselves and engage their audiences, at an unprecedented and increasing rate. In this paper, we revisit the popularity prediction on Instagram. We present a robust, efficient, and explainable baseline for population-based popularity prediction, achieving strong ranking performance. We employ the latest methods in computer vision to maximize the information extracted from the visual modality. We use transfer learning to extract visual semantics such as concepts, scenes, and objects, allowing a new level of scrutiny in an extensive, explainable ablation study. We inform feature selection towards a robust and scalable model, but also illustrate feature interactions, offering new directions for further inquiry in computational social science. Our strongest models inform a lower limit to population-based predictability of popularity on Instagram. The models are immediately applicable to social media monitoring and influencer identification."

          "The past four decades have witnessed an explosion of research into ethnic conflict. The overarching question addressed in the voluminous and still growing literature is this: Under what cultural, social, economic, political, and international conditions is ethnic conflict or peace more likely? Limiting my survey to the onset of ethnic war, I divide the literature into four waves and critically examine its theoretical and empirical progress. I contend that the field has indeed made impressive progress, both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, the field has moved well beyond the unproductive debate of the three paradigms (i.e., primordialism, instrumentalism, and constructivism), and there is an emerging consensus that we need to draw valid elements from all three paradigms and beyond. In addition, neo-institutionalism has (re-)emerged as a major approach in the field. Empirically, powered by increasingly sophisticated methods and technologies such as the Geography Information System (GIS) and the availability of more and better datasets, inquiries into ethnic conflict have not only ventured into exciting new territories but also gained deeper and fine-grained knowledge into the causes of ethnic war. I then highlight several recent studies that bring out impressive theoretical and empirical syntheses that may well portend better things to come. Finally, I identify several venues for further scientific progress, including tighter coupling between theorization and empirical hypotheses, getting the basics of methods right, gathering more fine-grained data that measure the level of ethnic politics, bringing together ethnic politics and other key topics in the wide social sciences, and forecasting the risk of ethnic war based on computational social sciences.",

          "Interactions between mainstream societies and minorities lead to the emergence of many societal problems, such as political mobilization with the aim to maintain power of majority members and exclude members of immigrant origin. The overarching question for this cumulative dissertation is: how can computational methods at the intersection of computer science and statistics be applied to provide new insights for the study of ethnic minorities? The articles for this dissertation include findings from research across three related and interconnected domains: ethnic discrimination in the sharing economy, political representation of ethnic minorities and collective action driven by xenophobia. In the preface I discuss both the substantial contributions of these articles as well as technical details about the application of computational methods. I close with some remarks about the present and the future of Computational Social Science",

          "Computational social science provides an innovative set of methodological tools that can help answer questions of substantive interest to migration and integration research. In this introductory article, we first provide a brief history of how computational approaches have already enriched migration and integration research. Second, we identify several key promises of computational migration research (e.g. better access to hard-to-reach populations, cost reductions and time savings, better detection of causal mechanisms, avoidance of response biases and methodological nationalism through fine-grained, time-stamped, live digital trace data) and key challenges (e.g. missing categories, sampling issues, ethical concerns). Third, we illustrate how the contributions of this special issue fulfil some of these promises – as well as deal with the challenges – to gain new insights into key questions of migration and integration research that address why people emigrate, what the evolution of structural patterns in migration networks is, whether refugee movements can be predicted, how host communities respond to the influx of refugees, how people interpret, frame, and discuss these arrivals, how migration-related discourse responds to external shocks, and how spatial segregation patterns of migrants and ethnic minorities emerge."
